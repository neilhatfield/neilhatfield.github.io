          A decision was made that sample responses to the questions posted here
          would not be posted.  We (math ed grad students) felt that sample
          responses should only come from the faculty.  <br />
          <br />
          <h2><a name="Tips"></a>Tips</h2>
          <br />
              Talk with each other.  Share your ideas.  As you can see below,
          collaboration can produce fruitful artifacts for everyone involved. 
          Be active participants in synthesizing the material.  Don't be shy
          about asking questions of each other.  Feel free to ask questions to
          the other grad students and the faculty.<br />
          <br />
              Search for connections between everything you have read in RUME
          1/2.  Try to move beyond blatantly obvious connections such as "these
          two articles are both about functions" and look deeper.  These
          connections will help you get deeper meanings out of the articles and
          will give you an ability to start truly synthesizing the literature.<br />
          <br />
              As you read articles, don't take everything stated as a given.  If
          something seems very odd, question it.  If you don't understand why a
          researcher made the choice/move he/she did, question it.  If a
          conclusion is presented, question it.  If you like/dislike the
          article, question yourself.  This sounds very much like "question
          everything" there is a subtle difference.  "Question everything" tends
          to make one adopt a hardline stance of opposition to the article and
          we don't necessarily recommend this.  Instead, the attitude here is
          meant to get you reflect upon your own stumbling blocks and
          interpretations.  If you read something that is odd, ask yourself why
          you think "it" is odd, what makes this thing odd.  If you don't
          understand something, reflect on the nature of why you feel you don't
          understand that thing.  Read previous sections of the paper again,
          look at referenced work.  Generating questions is easy; generating
          reflective questions that require you to grapple with the material is
          harder but not impossible.<br />
          <br />
              Whatever answer you give to a question, one of the most important
          things to do is to <strong>defend your answer with as much
            specificity as possible.</strong> Your answer is of less importance
          when compared to how you go about defending and explaining your answer
          so that <strong>someone not in your head</strong> can understand your
          position. <strong> </strong><br />
          <br />
              For what you believe to be the most important
          constructs/sub-constructs of each paper, type out the definitions
          (that you believe to be consistent with the author's intended meaning)
          from memory. For each construct, provide examples, counter-examples
          (when relevant), connections to other papers that might have used
          similar terminology, and initial misconceptions. After doing so, go
          back to the original paper to compare and see what you didn't remember
          and/or fully understand.<br />
          <br />
              While the RUME 1/2 qualifier is important, you should not stress
          yourself to the point of sickness, panic attacks, etc.  Remember to
          breathe and relax. When you do this, you will be in a better position
          to put forward your best thinking.<br />
          <br />
              Make flashcards to help you make sure that you can define
          important constructs for each paper. While reading a paper and saying
          "I got these constructs" is easy when the paper is in front of you (or
          in context), applying the constructs in new/different situations is
          much more difficult. This is especially true when in a testing
          situation.  Flashcards could have questions like: 1) What are the
          stages of co-variational reasoning? 2) What construct were used in
          Oertman's paper to describe student thinking about limits?  You can
          always make multiple flashcards for each paper. Getting specific with
          your flashcards is not a bad idea.  This way you have a level of
          detail at-the-ready for answering questions that can be rather
          specific and require attention to detail.<br />
          <br />
           You may also want to prepare a notes document like this: <a target="_blank"
            href="resources/Tallman-RUME1-Exam-Notes.pdf"
            class="bodylinks">RUME1
            Exam Notes.</a> <br />
          <br />
              Smile; you will survive.<br />
          <br />
              When you are done with the qualifier, go out for a beer/drink. 
          Socializing (and celebrating finishing the qualifier) is a nice way to
          unwind. We are more than willing to celebrate with you.<br />
