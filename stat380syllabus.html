                        A case study-based course in the use of computing and statistical reasoning to answer data-intensive questions. STAT 380 Data Science Through Statistical Reasoning and Computation (3) This course addresses the fact that real data are often messy by taking a holistic view of statistical analysis to answer questions of interest. Various case studies will lead students from the computationally intensive process of obtaining and cleaning data, through exploratory techniques, and finally to rudimentary inferential statistics. This process will exploit students' exposure to introductory statistics as well as the R programming language -hence the required prerequisites- yet novel computing and analytical techniques will also be introduced throughout the course. For the collection of data, students will learn scripting and database querying skills; for their exploration, they will employ R capabilities for graphical and summary statistics; and for their analysis, they will build upon the basic concepts obtained in their introductory statistics course. The varied case studies will elucidate additional statistical topics such as identifying sources of bias and searching for highdimensional outliers.

                <p>
                    In terms of textbooks, we will draw from a variety of sources which will be posted in Canvas. We will primarily use the following textbooks:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr3e/" target="_blank" class="bodylinks">Modern Data Science with R by Baumer, Kaplan, and Horton</a> (available for free at link).</li>

                <p>
                    I will try to post additional books, references, and potentially helpful material as the semester progresses in Canvas.
                </p>
                <h3 id="technology">Technology Needs</h3>
                <p>
                    As a technology based course, you will need access to the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A computer running either Windows, Mac OS, or Linux. If you do not have a personal computer or
                        laptop, you can make use of any of the many computers available both in our classroom and labs
                        around campus.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>If using your own computer/laptop:</em>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                You will need to install R on your machine. You can download the latest version at <a
                                    class="bodylinks" target="_blank"
                                    href="https://cran.r-project.org/">https://cran.r-project.org/</a>. If you have R
                                already installed, you should check the version and update to the latest. As of 8/17/23,
                                the most recent R Version is 4.3.1 "Beagle Scouts".
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                You will also want to download (or update) RStudio Desktop.
                                You can do so from <a class="bodylinks" target="_blank"
                                    href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/">https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/</a>.
                                Again, if you already have RStudio Desktop, you should check for and apply any updates.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>
                        <em>If you are using PSU owned computers, both of these programs are already
                            installed.</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Internet access so that you can access the course site in Canvas and other course
                        materials.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Beyond the above elements, I've done what I can to minimize additional costs to you. You should not need to purchase any accounts, books, or other materials. Any reading materials will be linked in Canvas.

                <h3 id="shared-responsibilities">Shared Responsibilities--Rules of Engagement</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Speak with Meaning:</strong> Everything that a person says should carry meaning to others. Each of us needs to do our best to avoid vague phrases and pronouns without clear antecedents (i.e., what the pronoun refers to). Explain and justify your reasoning, statements, arguments, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Exhibit Intellectual Integrity:</strong> Base your statements on what you  understand and what you're still wrestling with. There is courage and power in admitting to where you are struggling. Avoid making statements that reflect what you believe are what someone else wants to hear. Each of us should feel empowered to express your confusion and/or struggles with the material. This will help make the class much more productive for everyone.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Strive to Make Sense:</strong> There are underlying threads of coherence between various ideas we'll talk about throughout the course. As your instructor, I'll do my best to raise your awareness of these threads. However, I can't do your learning, thinking, or growing for you. Thus, you must take the lead in your education throughout the course. Each of you has a powerful support system you can make use of: your peers and your instructor. You may encounter ideas that run counter to what you understand--do not dismiss them out of hand; seek to understand the nature of those ideas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Respect the Learning Process of Others:</strong> Allow people the opportunity to think, reflect, and construct their understandings. When assisting your students or your peers, pose questions to help them construct meaning rather than show them how to get an answer.
                    </li>

                <h3>Updated: Attendance and Participation Policies</h3>
                <p>
                    Attendance and participation are vitally important for our class community. Attending each class session is an important part of becoming a professional member of our community. However, attendance alone will not guarantee that each person will get the most they can out of the course. This is where your participation comes into play. I will do what I can to provide a variety of ways for people to participate.
                </p>
                <h4 id="attendance">Attendance</h4>
                <p>
                    You will need to attend each class session baring illness, participation in a Univeristy
                    sanctioned event, or religious observance/practice. We know from past education research
                    that absences can negatively affect students' success. I want you each to find success in this course so please let me know if you are going to be absent so that we might work together to ensure you don't get off track.
                </p>

                <h2 id="assignments">How does grading work? (Assignments and Assessment)</h2>
                <h3>My Assessment Approach</h3>
                <p>
                    I believe that assessments are a key way for us to grow and learn together. I strive to create
                    assessments which provide you with opportuntities to practice what you've been learning as well as
                    push you to continue to grow. I encourage you to view any assignments as an opportunity to engage in
                    self-reflection.
                </p>
                <h3>Updated: Types of Assignments</h3>
                <p>
                    Throughout the semester, we'll have a variety of assignments for you to complete either
                    individually or as part of a group.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Readings and Discussions:</strong> we will each need to read/watch the assigned articles, reports, videos, chapters, etc. ahead of the scheduled class session. These artifacts will be the basis for class discussions. In some cases, there may be reading quizzes over the readings. Some of these quizzes might be due before the reading will be discussed in class; others might be due after class discussions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>In-class Activities:</strong> each week we will have an activity packet that you will need to complete and submit. I've designed the activities to support you in developing powerful ways of thinking. Unless specifically stated in a particular activity that students need to work independently, you are encouraged to work on these activities in groups of no more than (five) 5 students.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Homework:</strong> You will have several homework assignments throughout the
                        semester. These assignments are meant to provide you with opportunities to practice what we've discussed in class and/or put you in a beneficial position for other activities, projects, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>(Updated) Tests:</strong> The Fall 2023 class has voted to not have any tests.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>(Updated) Final Exam:</strong> The Fall 2023 class has voted for there to be an optional final exam. Neil will do his best to ensure that the exam is beneficial for students, subject to the constraints of the system. The final exam--should students elect to take it--will be take home and untimed. Students may begin working on it at 8am the Monday of finals week. The exam must be submitted by 5pm the Friday of finals week. Students will be allowed to use their personal notes for the exam.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Final Project:</strong> The final project provides students with an opportunity to apply what they have learned throughout the semester to a new situation. Additional details about the project will be shared in class.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="late-passes">(Updated) Late Submissions</h3>
                <p>
                    Assignments that are part of MyOpenMath (MOM) will allow each student to use a Late Pass to given themselves additional time to complete the assignment. The Fall 2023 class has voted to have each late pass grant 48 hours of time and students may use up to two (2) late passes on any assignment (provided late passes are allowed on that assignment and they have that many passes left). Not all assignments will be eligible for using late passes (e.g., group assignment, quizzes, tests).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You do not need to ask me to use a late pass. These are things you can automatically
                    use in the homework system.
                </p>
                <h3 id="extensions">Extension Requests</h3>
                <p>You may also contact me about getting a limited extension. This is particularly
                    useful if you are out of late passes, need more than 48 (96) hours, or are dealing
                    with an assignment not eligible for late passes. The process to request an extension
                    is the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contact me a minimum of one day/24 hours before the posted due date of the
                        assignment.</li>
                    <li>Show that you have made some progress on the assignment already.</li>
                    <li>Explain why you need the additional time.</li>
                    <li>Propose a new due date.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I will review each request on a case-by-case basis and get back to you with the
                    extended due date that I grant you, which might not be the date you propose. Until
                    you hear back from me, please do not assume that you have the extension. You may
                    only ask for one extension per assignment.</p>
                <h3 id="emergency">Emergency Extensions/Illness</h3>
                <p>Life happens and things can suddenly go sideways. In such an event, please reach out
                    to me as soon as you can so that we can work together to get you back on track.</p>
                <p>If you find yourself asking for multiple extensions, please reach out to me to
                    discuss what’s going on. I’ll do the same if I feel that you’ve made a large number
                    of extension requests.</p>
                <h3 id="viewed-answers">Viewing Answers</h3>
                <p>Due to the existence of late passes and extensions, I will not make full answer keys
                    available to students until after all assignments are submitted. Calculational
                    answers will be available in the homework system once you've submitted the
                    assignment and the due date has passed. Keep in mind that if you view those answers
                    after the due date, the system will bar you from using a Late Pass.</p>
                <h3 id="testing-policy">Testing Policy</h3>
                <p><mark>The class will vote on the conditions for tests and final exam.</mark></p>
                <h3 id="grading">Grading Policy</h3>
                <p>
                    I use a Standards-Based Grading System in this course. This means that I live and breath
                    the learning outcomes when thinking about assessing each one of you. Throughout each assignment 
                    (homework, quizzes, tests, final exam, and course project), every question connects to at least
                    one of the learning outcomes. Each time you answer a question, you are adding to the body of
                    evidence about your understanding for each outcome. I use that entire body of evidence to evaluate
                    where you end up for each learning outcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In an ideal world, I would report multiple grades to the Registrar; one for each of the Learning Outcomes.
                    However, Penn State is not advanced enough in their thinking to do such a thing--they are living in a
                    distorated past. I can only report a single letter grade. Thus, at the end of the semester, I am tasked
                    with determining the most appropriate letter grade based upon the semester's worth of data on the
                    Learning Outcomes and Learning Objectives for each of you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I do this in a data driven way thus each semester is a little bit different. This allows me to make
                    adjustments to account for the unique elements of each semester. The general process involves me looking
                    at the following:
                </p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>How many of your assessed Learning Outcomes are at the Adept or Highly Developed  Proficiency Level?</li>
                    <li>How many of your assessed Learning Outcomes are at any of the three Proficiency levels (Adept, Highly Developed, Skillful)?</li>
                    <li>How many of your assessed Learning Objectives are at the Adept or Highly Developed Proficiency Level?</li>
                    <li>How many of your assessed Learning Objectives are at any of the three Proficiency levels (Adept, Highly Developed, Skillful)?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Notice that I focus on Learning Outcomes and Objectives; I'm not looking at homework scores, assessment
                    scores, your participation, or your attendance. The assessment scores are a function of learning outcomes
                    but can create confusion. For example, if you demonstrate Adept Proficiency on one Learning Objective but
                    Not Yet, Not Shown on another--and the assignment is just those two questions--the assignment score looks
                    like a 50%; you don't get the credit for the outcome you have a great understanding of.
                    Your participation and attendance will impact your learning, thus there's no need to grade you on them.
                    Grading participation and attendance can also unfairly impact students in a number of ways.

                    The Pennsylvania State University campuses are located on the original homelands of the
                    Erie, Haudenosaunee (Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, Mohawk, and Tuscarora), Lenape
                    (Delaware Nation, Delaware Tribe, Stockbridge-Munsee), Monongahela, Shawnee (Absentee,

                    target="_blank" class="bodylinks">land grant</a> institution, we acknowledge and honor
                    the traditional caretakers of these lands and strive to understand and model their
                    responsible stewardship. We also acknowledge the longer history of these lands and
                    our place in that history.

                <h3 id="gender">Gender Identity</h3>
                <p>
                    Our institution's official policy states that "The Pennsylvania State University recognizes
                    the need or preference for members of the University community to refer to themselves by a first
                    name other than their legal first name as well as self-assert a gender other than their legal gender
                    or their gender at the time of birth (AD 84)." One way we can support self-identification is by
                    honoring the name and pronouns that each of us go by.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many people (e.g. international students, performers/writers, trans &amp; non-binary people,
                    and others) might go by a name in daily life that is different from their legal name. In this
                    classroom, we seek to refer to people by the names that they go by.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pronouns can be a way to affirm someone's gender identity, but they can also be unrelated to
                    a person's identity. They are simply a public way in which people are referred to in place of
                    their name (e.g., "he" or "she" or "they" or "ze" or something else). In this classroom, you are
                    invited (if you want to) to share what pronouns you go by, and we seek to refer to people using the
                    pronouns that they share. The pronouns someone indicates are not necessarily indicative of their
                    gender identity.

                    One of the greatest things about being human is that we are each our own unique person. As such,
                    there is a whole realm of neurodiveristy in any classroom. What some people need to have comfort
                    and success in our class will be different from those of others. We welcome all individuals from
                    across the neurodiviersity spectrum. I ask that we provide grace and space for all people to be
                    themselves.

                <p>
                    A central aspect of education is that you build your knowledge and develop ways of thinking
                    that will support you in your life and career. As one of your educators, part of my role is
                    to assess your learning so that I can help you build the most productive ways of thinking. In
                    order for me to best help you, I need the most accurate and reliable data about your thinking
                    and learning. Academic integrity is a key to this process.

                <h3 id="ai-types">What are the different ways in which a person might violate academic integrity policies?</h3>
                <p>
                    There are many different ways in which a person's actions may directly or indirectly lead to violating Academic Integrity. Keep in mind whether a person acts intentionally or accidentaly, that action could still result in violating Academic Integrity. The best advice I can give is to <strong>always talk with your instructors <em>before</em> you submit the assignment</strong>. Here are a few of the broad categories of actions that lead to violation of academic integrity.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plagiarism:</strong> This action occurs when someone presents someone else's work as their own, including their own. This can describe situations from forgetting to cite a source to copying someone's work without their knowledge. Avoid plagiarism by citing your sources (for figures, images, code, etc.) and giving credit to the ideas and work of others.</li>
                    <li><strong>Self-Plagarism:</strong> Self-plagiarism occurs when a person submits work that they've
                        submitted elsewhere; for example, taking a paper from one class and submitting that paper
                        (even with minor changes) for a grade in a different class without prior authorization.
                        Avoid self-plagarism by talking with your instructors about whether improving a past assignment
                        might be work for the assignment's learning objectives.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collusion:</strong> This action is similar to plagiarism but rather than one person
                        being at fault, multiple people are working together. If one person gives another the answers
                        to an assignment, that person is violating Academic Integrity just as much as the person
                        submitting the assignment. Keep in mind that collusion can happen between students who
                        aren't enrolled in the same section or even the same course. Avoid collusion by verifying
                        with your instructor from the start whether you can work with others; then be sure to give credit
                        to who did what.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ghost Writing:</strong> This action is a more consequential form of collusion. Here someone
                        does and submits work the behalf of someone else, by pretending to be this other person. Typically,
                        the ghost writer is getting some benefit (e.g., a payment) to do the work, but not always. Avoid
                        ghost writing by doing your own work; if you need assistance (e.g., typing assistance) be sure to
                        talk with your instructor and the <a href="https://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources" 
                        class="bodylinks" target="_blank">Student Disabilty Resources Office</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improper Technology Use:</strong> What qualifers as proper and improper technology usage
                        will vary from course to course. Generally, this captures any actions where technology plays a
                        central role in the violation. This spans actions such as (but not limited to) using devices
                        that aren't allowed on the assignment, using artificial intelligence systems (e.g., chatbots),
                        using messaging groups to share answers, and getting/posting answers online (e.g., sites like Chegg,
                        CourseHero, etc.). At the core of all these actions lies a person presenting someone else's work
                        as their own. Avoid using technology improperly by seeking clarification about when, how, and what
                        technologies are allowed on assignments.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The best advice I can provide is to talk with your instructor before you submit any assignment. Once
                    you submit, you've solidified your action and there isn't anything your instructor can except to
                    report the violation.
                </p>
                <p>                    
                    A person violates academic integrity when they act in a way either (dis-)advantages themselves or
                    (dis-)advantages someone else that is not explicitly allowed ahead of time. While people have a
                    variety of reasons for choosing to act in such ways (e.g., stress, lack of time, perssure to perform,
                    etc.), we need to keep in mind that choosing to violate academic integrity impacts everyone. The
                    person violating academic integrity weakens their own academic growth--they do not receive the
                    feedback that is actually necessary for their growth. The class community suffers as such cases
                    delay giving feedback, and erode the sense of trust in the community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is expected that any work submitted is your own. Class members may work on homework
                    assignments and lab assignments in groups, but each student must write up answers in their own words
                    and submit lab quizzes and homework assignments separately.
                </p>
                <h3 id="ai-differences">What are the differences between collusion, people working together, and group work?</h3>
                <p>
                    The major distinction between collusion, working together, and group work comes down to what
                    has been explicitly allowed by the instructor. Collusion is never allowed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I encourage students to <strong>work together</strong> on assignments. However, when students work
                    together, each person is individually responsible for their own work. Having one person answer the
                    questions, write the code, etc. and then pass the results to the other person is <em>not</em> working
                    together. Rather, each person should be engaged in the problems, sharing ideas, thoughts, and approaches.
                    The individual differences in how we each write and talk should be present in the answers and work each
                    person submits. Working together can enrich the learning of all those who are actively participating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Group work</strong> occurs when the instructor gives an activity or assignment that is meant
                    to be completed by a group of students together with a single submission for the group. This is not
                    a violation of academic integrity due to the specifications the instructor has set up for the assignment. 
                </p>
                <h3 id="ai-help">Where can I get help for this course?</h3>
                <p>
                    Part of learning involves running into situations where you don't instantly have a solution.
                    Rather, you have to think about the problem, try a few things, and then pieces fall into place.
                    You do not have to engage in such struggles alone. Getting help is a great way to help you engage 
                    in <em>productive struggle</em> that leads to better learning. However, not all sources of help
                    will actually support your learning and growth. Here are my suggestions for places to seek help.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Check your course notes and class recordings.</li>
                    <li>Check the documentation in R.</li>
                    <li>Talk with your classmates.</li>
                    <li>Make use of Student Hours.</li>
                    <li>Email your instructor.</li>
                    <li>Talk to others who are not part of our course. (Use caution.)</li>
                    <li>Search the internet. (Use caution.)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    You'll notice that on the last two I've placed the phrase "Use caution." While you might learn
                    how to handle the specific problem you ask about, there's no guarantee that what you get from 
                    these will help you later on in the course. Additionally, there may be differences in approaches
                    that might cause you more problems. For example, online resources (e.g., Stack Overflow) may
                    show solutions that are 1) out of date/not recommended anymore, 2) rely on packages that are no 
                    longer available, 3) use techniques that are well-beyond what we're trying to do, 4) and/or cause 
                    new problems when you attempt to incorporate them into your work. If you find a solution online 
                    or got from someone not associated with our course, feel free to come talk to me about it. We 
                    can go over it together and I can show you how we can evaluate such advice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you are getting help be sure that you are not crossing the line and having someone else do your
                    learning for you.
                </p>
                <h3 id="ai-chatbots">Can I use ChatBots/Generative AI in this course?</h3>
                <p>
                    Chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Bard appear confident in the answers they provide.
                    However, their answers are not always logical nor stand up to scrutiny. If a person relies upon
                    chatbots to do their work, they will miss out on critical opportunities to develop the ways of
                    thinking necessary to detect problems with AI generated answers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An important part aspect of this course is to help you develop foundational ways of thinking about
                    programming in R so that you can go on to write your own code for conducting analyses. Overly relying
                    on other tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Bard, CodePilot, Stack Overflow, etc.) will limit your growth. This
                    can then have implications for your job if you are constantly using these tools to do your work. 
                    Therefore, unless explicit permission is given for a particular assignment, the entire class community
                    (the instructor, the students, TAs, etc.) should actively refrain from using generative AI tools. 
                    When such use is explicitly authorized, that work should be properly documented. Direct usage of output
                    from chatbots should be treated much like a direct quotation; derivations of such output should 
                    be treated as paraphrased text.
                </p>

                <h3>University Closings</h3>
                <p>
                    Should the university close due to weather or campus emergencies, please be sure to follow
                    any directions included in the University's official announcement. You can stay up to date on such
                    announcements by signing up for PSUAlert (<a href="https://psualert.psu.edu/psualert"
                        class="bodylinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://psualert.psu.edu/psualert</a>)
                    and/or following Penn State on social media.</p>
                <p>In the event of university closure, we will not meet in person. Please check your PSU email
                    and Canvas for further course announcements.
                </p>
                <h3>Instructor Absence</h3>
                <p>
                    In the event that I'm not able to attend class, I will send out an annoucement for what the
                    plan will be. This may include having a guest speaker/instructor (a substitute), for work time
                    (independent or in groups), or cancel the session. Such information will be announced as needed via
                    PSU email/Canvas.
                </p>
                <h3>Deferred Grades</h3>
                <p>
                    If you are prevented from completing this course within the prescribed amount of time for
                    reasons that are beyond your control, it is possible to have the grade deferred with the concurrence
                    of the instructor, following <a class="bodylinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                        href="http://senate.psu.edu/policies-and-rules-for-undergraduate-students/47-00-48-00-and-49-00-grades/#48-40">Penn
                        State Deferred Grade Policy 48-40</a>. To seek a deferred grade, you must submit a
                    written request (by e-mail or U.S. post) to the instructor describing the reason(s) for the request.
                    Non-emergency permission for filing a deferred grade must be requested before the beginning of the
                    final examination period. It is up to the instructor to determine whether or not you will be
                    permitted to receive a deferred grade. If permission is granted, you will work with the
                    instructor to establish a communication plan and a clear schedule for completion within policy. If,
                    for any reason, the coursework for the deferred grade is not complete by the assigned time, a grade
                    of "F" will be automatically entered on your transcript.
                </p>
                <h3>Syllabus Changes</h3>
                <p>
                    The syllabus for this course (and all other course syllabi) <em>does not</em> constitute a
                    legal contract. Further, I intend for this syllabus to change to reflect the decisions we
                    make as a community on several areas listed above as well as adapting to our needs
                    throughout the semester. Changes to the syllabus will be announced in class and updated here.
