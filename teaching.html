          <h3>STP 231-Statistics for the Biosciences</h3>
          <h3>STP 420-Introductory Applied Statistics</h3>
          <p>These courses all serve as an introductory course to Statistics.  As is my trend in teaching statistics courses, this course focuses on integrating technology as
            well as modern approaches to Statistics.  Students leaving this
            course will have a solid foundation of core concepts in Statistics
            that will serve them well in later courses.  Students will work in
            groups to complete a semester long Data Analysis Project so that
            they have experience putting what they learn into practice, using
            real world data. </p>

          <p>For this course, students will need to download and install JMP 13
            Pro from MyApps (part of My ASU).</p>
          <p>Additionally, students will need to access the following online

          <h3>STP 226-Elements of Statistics</h3>
          <p>This course serves as an introductory course to Statistics. This
            course is open to students in any major. As is my trend in teaching
            statistics courses, this course focuses on integrating technology as
            well as modern approaches to Statistics.  Students leaving this
            course will have a solid foundation of core concepts in Statistics
            that will serve them well in later courses.  Students will work in
            groups to complete a semester long Data Analysis Project so that
            they have experience putting what they learn into practice, using
            real world data. </p>
            <h3>MAT 210-Brief Calculus</h3>
          <p>Brief Calculus, also known as Business Calculus, serves as a first
            course in a calculus sequence that focuses on applications of the
            core ideas in calculus in the business world. The course site may be
            accessed through BlackBoard.</p>
          <h3>STP 420-Introductory Applied Statistics</h3>
          <p>This course serves as an upper division, introductory course. I
            have the pleasure of redesigning this course for the school.
            Students will use software throughout the semester (specifically,
            JMP Pro) as they wrestle with the various concepts.</p>
          <p>The course website can be accessed here: <a class="bodylinks" target="_blank"
              href="https://imathas.rationalreasoning.net">iMathAS</a>.</p>
          <h3>STP 231-Statistics for the Biosciences</h3>
          <p>This course is the required introduction to statistics for all life
            science majors at ASU. In this course we will take a hands-on
            approach to the foundational ideas of Statistics.  Students will
            work in groups to complete an Exploratory Data Analysis project so
            that they may learn first-hand just a few of the intricacies of
            doing Statistics.</p>
          <p>For this course, students will need to download JMP (JMP Pro) from
            MyApps (part of MyASU) or R/RStudio. Additional information about
            the course is in the <a class="bodylinks" href="STP231-Syllabus-F16-Hatfield.pdf">syllabus</a>.</p>
          <p>The course website can be accessed here: <a class="bodylinks" target="_blank"
              href="imathas.rationalreasoning.net">iMathAS</a>.</p>
          <p>Additionally, students in STP231 will need to use the following
            pages:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a class="bodylinks" target="_blank" href="FishSampling.html">Fish
                Sampling</a> (Web App)</li>
            <li><a class="bodylinks" href="PeopleSamplingWeb.html" target="_blank">People
                Sampling</a> (Web App)</li>
            <li><a class="bodylinks" target="_blank" href="CPF/CPF.html">CPF
                Calculator</a> (Page)</li>
            <li><a class="bodylinks" target="_blank" href="restricted/F16FinalExam.html">Final
                Exam</a> (Restricted Access)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Additional resources will be published to this page as the semester
            continues.</p>
          <p>This course section focuses on students building productive
            meanings for the core ideas of Statistics. In particular, I've
            designed this course so that students develop the view that
            statistics are functions of data which provide measures of a data
            collection's attributes. This approach puts quantitative reasoning
            as a core component; students must engage in quantification.
            Additionally, this course provides a rigorous treatment of the idea
            of distribution which underpins all of statistical inference. </p>

          <h3>Summer 2016A: Pre-calculus (ASU)</h3>
          <p>The Summer 2016 Pre-calculus courses are the products of
            redesigning a research-based curriculum (Pathways to Precalculus) to
            emphasize co-variational and quantitative reasoning. During this
            course, students repeatedly had to reason about how different
            quantities' values co-varied in animations and video clips. Through
            the instructional sequence, students built and refined mathematical
            tools such as the Cartesian and Polar coordinate systems, graphs,
            and average-rate-of-change. Students learned how using this last
            tool could enable them to categorize different types of co-variation
            and build mathematical models that describe that co-variation.</p>
