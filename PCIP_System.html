        <p>This Plan-Code-Improve-Polish (PCIP) System is an approach that we can apply to any data analysis or programing project. The goal behind this system to help structure our thinking so that we can spend our time productively rather than getting stuck and spinning our wheels. Check out each part of the system and what questions we might ask ourselves in general, in programming contexts, and when making data visualizations (both tables and plots).</p>
        <h2>Plan</h2>

            <p>Planning is the <em><strong>most</strong></em> important step we can take. This is where we will articulate what we are ultimately trying to do. Keep in mind that good plans include the following three core elements and one optional element.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Statement of Goal(s):</strong> Identify what you are ultimately/primarily trying to do. As you do so, be open to breaking this goal down into smaller sub-goals and tasks.</li>
              <li><strong>Statement of Needs:</strong> Identify what you'll need to achieve each of your goals and sub-goals. This would include noun-type objects (e.g., data files, image files, packages, resources) and verb-type objects (e.g., functions, actions,).</li>
              <li><strong>List of Steps:</strong> Using your list of needs, you can bring the nouns and verbs together to create a list of steps/actions that will help you achieve each sub-goal and then your ultiamte/primary goal. Numbering the steps can help you organize your actions in terms of which goals rely on other goals.</li>
              <li><strong>Make a sketch:</strong> (<em>Optional</em>) If appropriate to your goal(s), try making a sketch of what you currently imagine the end product looking like. The sketch does not need to be fancy as its purpose to help provide you with a visual reminder of what you're aiming for. This is useful with creating data visualizations, dashboards, or apps.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

        <p>
          Keep in mind that planning is not always linear. Sometimes you'll be writing out your steps and realize that you're going to need something that you didn't previously think of. Similarly, you might decide that you should create a new sub-goal so you can have sharper focus on a particular task.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Questions to Ask Ourselves During the Planning Stage</h3>
        <p>
          Here are a few questions that we can ask ourselves to help us generate a plan.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What is your goal? What are you trying to do?</li>
          <li>What data do you need? What data do you have?</li>
          <li>Is the data tidy? Do you need to tidy or otherwise wrangle the data?</li>
          <li><strong>In a Programming Context</strong></li>
          <ul>
            <li>What do you need in terms of nouns and verbs?</li>
            <li>What do you have?</li>
            <li>What steps do you need to work through so that the computer can help you reach your goal?</li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong>In a Data Visualizations Context</strong></li>
          <ul>
            <li>What steps do you need to carry out to create the visualization?</li>
            <li>What kind of visualization do you want? What geometry (-ies) do you need?</li>
            <li>Sketch what you're looking to create.</li>
            <li>What goes into your Framework? Content? Labels?</li>
            <li>How many layers do you need?</li>
            <li>Do you need to use an interactive system to get started?</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A great way to think about planning is to think about baking a cake. While our utlimate goal is to have an iced/decorated cake to share with others, we know that we are going to need at least three sub-goals: make/bake the cake, make the icing, and decorate/ice the cake. Working from needed recipes, we can put together our list of ingredients and tools. Then, we can start following the steps of the recipes. The act of planning is aligned with the cooking term <em>mise en place</em> meaning "putting in place" all the necessary elements so that we can achieve our goal.
