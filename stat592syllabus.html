                <h2 id="courseDescp">Course Description</h2>
                <p>This course is designed to help students become better teachers and communicators of statistics.
                    Further,
                    the course seeks to prepare students to supervise undergraduate statistics students in lab, small
                    group settings,
                    and as the lead instructor of undergraduate courses. Students learn about and discuss pedagogy in
                    statistics, gain
                    experience with practice teaching, and improve via individual feedback.
                </p>
                <p>Focus will be on skills and best practices for leading a class or discussion. You have the luxury of
                    being in a
                    department that has several faculty who are actively involved in Statistics Education research. In
                    fact, our
                    Statistics Department is one of the best in the country with regards to Statistics Education. Please
                    take advantaged
                    of this opportunity while you are part of thie community.

                <h2 id="goalsObjectives">Course Goals and Objectives</h2>
                <h3>Course Goals</h3>
                <p>Our current goal for Stat 592 is to provide graduate students of all backgrounds experiences
                    which will help them become successful educators whether they are leading labs/recitations,
                    overseeing small groups of students, or teaching their own sections of a statistics course.
                </p>
                <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
                <p>We have adopted the following learning objectives for this course.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Students will construct a practical understanding of the Guidelines for Assessment and
                        Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) 2016 college report.
                    </li>
                    <li>Students will develop their ability to de-center and think about potential student thinking
                        which might underpin student responses.
                    </li>
                    <li>Students will develop their own arsenal of pedagogical tools (e.g., active learning techniques,
                        questioning strategies, assessments) that they can incorporate into their teaching.
                    </li>
                    <li>Students will create and enact mini-teaching lessons.</li>
                    <li>Students will engage in self-reflection and self-evaluation in terms of pedagogical knowledge.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#topLinks" class="bodylinks">Return to top</a></p>
                <h2 id="responsibilities">Teacher and Student Responsibilities</h2>
                <p>All members of our class community have responsibilities.</p>
                <h3>Shared Responsibilities--Rules of Engagement</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Speak with Meaning:</strong> Everything that a person says should carry meaning to
                        others. Each of us needs to do our best to avoid vague phrases and pronouns without clear
                        antecedents (i.e., what the pronoun refers to). Explain and justify your reasoning, statements,
                        arguments, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Exhibit Intellectual Integrity:</strong> Base your statements on what you understand
                        and what you're still wrestling with. There is courage and power in admitting to where you
                        struggling. Avoid making statements that reflect what you believe are what someone else wants to
                        hear. Each of us should feel empowered to express your confusion and/or struggles with the
                        material. This will help make the class much more productive for everyone.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Strive to Make Sense:</strong> There are underlying threads of coherence between various
                        ideas we'll talk about throughout the course. As your instructor, I'll do my best to raise your
                        awareness of these threads. However, I can't do your learning, thinking, or growing for you.
                        Thus, you must take the lead in your education throughout the course. Each of you has a powerful
                        support system you can make use of: your peers and your instructor. You may encounter ideas that
                        run counter to what you understand--do not dismiss them out of hand; seek to understand the
                        nature of those ideas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Respect the Learning Process of Others:</strong> Allow people the opportunity to think,
                        reflect, and construct their understandings. When assisting your students or your peers, pose
                        questions to help them construct meaning rather than show them how to get an answer.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p><mark>To be determined by class discussion</mark></p>
                <h3>Teacher Responsibilities</h3>
                <p><mark>To be determined by class discussion</mark></p>
                <h3>Attendance and Participation Policy</h3>
                <p>
                    Attendance and participation are vitally important for our class community. Attending each class
                    session is an important part of becoming a professional member of our community. However, attendance
                    alone will not guarantee that each person will get the most they can out of the course. This is
                    where your participation comes into play. I will do what I can to provide a variety of ways
                    for people to participate.
                </p>
                <h4>Attendance</h4>
                <p>
                    You will need to attend each class session baring illness, participation in a Univeristy
                    sanctioned event, or religious observance/practice. Please let me know if you are going to
                    be absent. Abscences can jeopardize your final course grade.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students who are absent three or more times throughout the semester may receive a failing grade for
                    the course. (Note: Three abscences is equivalent to missing 20% of the course.)
                </p>
                <h4>Participation</h4>
                <p>Given that this course is primarily discussion based, your participation is absolutely necessary.
                    For this course, we agreed to define participation as:</p>
                <p><mark>To be determined by class discussion</mark></p>
                <p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#topLinks" class="bodylinks">Return to top</a></p>
                <h2 id="assignments">Assignments and Assessment</h2>
                <h3>My Assessment Approach</h3>
                <p>Given that this course is meant to help you become better teachers of statistics as well as
                    well as prepare you to supervise undergraduate students in a variety of situations, my
                    approach to assessment is pragmatic in nature. I am interested in your growth over the
                    semester. While a final grade will be assigned, we want you to focus on your participation
                    and reflections, not the accumulation of points.
                </p>
                <h3>Types of Assignments</h3>
                <p>For the most part, assignments in this course come in following types/flavors. All assignments are
                    meant
                    to help you get the most out of this course and to support everyone in havinga productive class
                    session.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Readings and Discussions:</strong> we will each need to read/watch the assigned
                        articles, reports, videos, chapters, etc. ahead of the scheduled class session. These
                        artifacts will be the basis for class discussions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Reflective Writings:</strong> you will be given prompts to respond. Some prompts
                        might entail summarizing class discussions, others might require you to engage in
                        self-reflection
                        and introspection. These writings will need to be submitted via Canvas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Teaching Demonstrations:</strong> each student will be asked to prepare at least one
                        teaching demonstration (details will be shared in the course). Further, I require that
                        every student participate in everyone else's teaching demonstration.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Late Submissions</h3>
                <p>Generally speaking, late submissions can have a negative impact not only on yourself but the rest
                    of our class community. Given the discussion-centered nature of this course, not completing
                    reading assignments ahead of class will greatly harm our community. We want to be the best
                    community members that we can be and support everyone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This also means that we need to be able to show and give grace to each other. We must all
                    acknowledge that sometimes unexpected things occur and can cause problems. To this end, we
                    need to keep open lines of communication. Reach out me and keep me informed of external pressures.
                    This will help us find submission times that work for people.
                </p>
                <h3>Examination Policy</h3>
                <p>This course will not have any tests or exams.</p>
                <h3>Grading Policy</h3>
                <p>
                    While there are different types of assignments, they are all equally important to your growth. Thus,
                    there no category weights.

                <h2 id="inclusion">Inclusive Practices</h2>
                <p>As a class community, we need to be respectful and welcoming of all members. Inclusive practices
                    start from day one and are important to me.
                </p>
                <h3>Gender Identity</h3>
                <p>
                    Our institution's official policy states that "The Pennsylvania State University recognizes the need
                    or preference for members of the University community to refer to themselves by a first name other
                    than their legal first name as well as self-assert a gender other than their legal gender or their
                    gender at the time of birth (AD 84)." One way we can support self-identification is by honoring the
                    name and pronouns that each of us go by.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many people (e.g. international students, performers/writers, trans &amp; non-binary people, and
                    others) might go by a name in daily life that is different from their legal name. In this classroom,
                    we seek to refer to people by the names that they go by.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pronouns can be a way to affirm someone's gender identity, but they can also be unrelated to a
                    person's identity. They are simply a public way in which people are referred to in place of their
                    name (e.g., "he" or "she" or "they" or "ze" or something else). In this classroom, you are invited
                    (if you want to) to share what pronouns you go by, and we seek to refer to people using the pronouns
                    that they share. The pronouns someone indicates are not necessarily indicative of their gender
                    identity.

                <p>
                    Penn State University has adopted a <a class="bodylinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

                    that is grounded in the policy that the &ldquo;University is committed to creating an educational
                    environment which is free from intolerance directed toward individuals or groups and strives to

                <p>

                <h3>Counseling and Psychological Services</h3>
                <p>
                    Many students at Penn State face personal challenges or have psychological needs that may interfere
                    with their academic progress, social development, or emotional well-being. The university offers a
                    variety of confidential services to help you through difficult times, including individual and group

                <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
                <p>
                    All Penn State policies regarding ethics and honorable behavior apply to this course. Academic
                    integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity free from fraud and deception and is an educational
                    objective of this institution. All University policies regarding academic integrity apply to this
                    course. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>cheating,</li>
                    <li>plagiarizing,</li>
                    <li>fabricating of information or citations,</li>
                    <li>facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others,</li>
                    <li>having unauthorized possession of examinations,</li>
                    <li>submitting work of another person or work previously used without informing the instructor, or
                        tampering with the academic work of other students,</li>
                    <li>sharing any course materials (e.g., assignments with or without answers; quizzes; exams; online
                        course notes) via personal communication or websites (e.g., Course Hero, Chegg, Quizlet, etc.)
                        other than those communications used as a part of the course,</li>
                    <li>copying from other students, answer keys, or solutions sets,</li>
                    <li>having a tutor complete an assignment.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These are all examples of academic dishonesty. Instructors regularly monitor the web for
                    inappropriate posting of instructional materials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is expected that any work submitted is your own. Class members may work on homework assignments
                    and lab assignments in groups, but each student must write up answers in their own words and submit
                    lab quizzes and homework assignments separately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any instances of academic dishonesty will be pursued under the&nbsp;<a class="bodylinks"

                <h3>Deferred Grades</h3>
                <p>
                    If you are prevented from completing this course within the prescribed amount of time for reasons
                    that are beyond your control, it is possible to have the grade deferred with the concurrence of the
                    instructor, following <a class="bodylinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                        href="http://senate.psu.edu/policies-and-rules-for-undergraduate-students/47-00-48-00-and-49-00-grades/#48-40">Penn
                        State Deferred Grade Policy 48-40</a>. To seek a deferred grade, you must submit a written
                    request (by e-mail or U.S. post) to the instructor describing the reason(s) for the request.
                    Non-emergency permission for filing a deferred grade must be requested before the beginning of the
                    final examination period. It is up to the instructor to determine whether or not you will be
                    permitted to receive a deferred grade. If permission is granted, you will work with the instructor
                    to establish a communication plan and a clear schedule for completion within policy. If, for any
                    reason, the coursework for the deferred grade is not complete by the assigned time, a grade of "F"
                    will be automatically entered on your transcript.

                <h3>Instructor Absence</h3>
                <p>
                    In the event that I'm not able to attend class, I will send out an annoucement for what the plan will
                    be. This may include having a guest speaker/instructor (a substitute), for work time (independent or
                    in groups), or cancel the session. Such information will be announced as needed via PSU
                    email/Canvas.
                </p>
                <h3>Syllabus Changes</h3>
                <p>
                    The syllabus for this course (and all other course syllabi) <em>does not</em> constitute a
                    legal contract. Further, I intend for this syllabus to change to reflect the decisions we
                    make as a community on several areas listed above as well as adapting to our needs
                    throughout the semester. Changes to the syllabus will announced in class and updated here.
