                <h2 id="courseDescp">Course Description</h2>
                <p>This course is designed to help students become better teachers and communicators of statistics.
                    Further,
                    the course seeks to prepare students to supervise undergraduate statistics students in lab, small
                    group settings,
                    and as the lead instructor of undergraduate courses. Students learn about and discuss pedagogy in
                    statistics, gain
                    experience with practice teaching, and improve via individual feedback.
                </p>
                <p>Focus will be on skills and best practices for leading a class or discussion. You have the luxury of
                    being in a
                    department that has several faculty who are actively involved in Statistics Education research. In
                    fact, our
                    Statistics Department is one of the best in the country with regards to Statistics Education. Please
                    take advantaged
                    of this opportunity while you are part of thie community.

                <h2 id="goalsObjectives">Course Goals and Objectives</h2>
                <h3>Course Goals</h3>
                <p>Our current goal for Stat 592 is to provide graduate students of all backgrounds experiences
                    which will help them become successful educators whether they are leading labs/recitations,
                    overseeing small groups of students, or teaching their own sections of a statistics course.
                </p>
                <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
                <p>We have adopted the following learning objectives for this course.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Students will construct a practical understanding of the Guidelines for Assessment and
                        Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) 2016 college report.
                    </li>
                    <li>Students will develop their ability to de-center and think about potential student thinking
                        which might underpin student responses.
                    </li>
                    <li>Students will develop their own arsenal of pedagogical tools (e.g., active learning techniques,
                        questioning strategies, assessments) that they can incorporate into their teaching.
                    </li>
                    <li>Students will create and enact mini-teaching lessons.</li>
                    <li>Students will engage in self-reflection and self-evaluation in terms of pedagogical knowledge.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#topLinks" class="bodylinks">Return to top</a></p>
                <h2 id="responsibilities">Teacher and Student Responsibilities</h2>
                <p>All members of our class community have responsibilities.</p>
                <h3>Shared Responsibilities--Rules of Engagement</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Speak with Meaning:</strong> Everything that a person says should carry meaning to
                        others. Each of us needs to do our best to avoid vague phrases and pronouns without clear
                        antecedents (i.e., what the pronoun refers to). Explain and justify your reasoning, statements,
                        arguments, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Exhibit Intellectual Integrity:</strong> Base your statements on what you understand
                        and what you're still wrestling with. There is courage and power in admitting to where you are
                        struggling. Avoid making statements that reflect what you believe are what someone else wants to
                        hear. Each of us should feel empowered to express your confusion and/or struggles with the
                        material. This will help make the class much more productive for everyone.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Strive to Make Sense:</strong> There are underlying threads of coherence between various
                        ideas we'll talk about throughout the course. As your instructor, I'll do my best to raise your
                        awareness of these threads. However, I can't do your learning, thinking, or growing for you.
                        Thus, you must take the lead in your education throughout the course. Each of you has a powerful
                        support system you can make use of: your peers and your instructor. You may encounter ideas that
                        run counter to what you understand--do not dismiss them out of hand; seek to understand the
                        nature of those ideas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Respect the Learning Process of Others:</strong> Allow people the opportunity to think,
                        reflect, and construct their understandings. When assisting your students or your peers, pose
                        questions to help them construct meaning rather than show them how to get an answer.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p><mark>To be determined by class discussion</mark></p>
                <h3>Teacher Responsibilities</h3>
                <p><mark>To be determined by class discussion</mark></p>
                <h3>Attendance and Participation Policy</h3>
                <p>
                    Attendance and participation are vitally important for our class community. Attending each class
                    session is an important part of becoming a professional member of our community. However, attendance
                    alone will not guarantee that each person will get the most they can out of the course. This is
                    where your participation comes into play. I will do what I can to provide a variety of ways
                    for people to participate.
                </p>
                <h4>Attendance</h4>
                <p>
                    You will need to attend each class session baring illness, participation in a Univeristy
                    sanctioned event, or religious observance/practice. Please let me know if you are going to
                    be absent. Abscences can jeopardize your final course grade.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students who are absent three or more times throughout the semester may receive a failing grade for
                    the course. (Note: Three abscences is equivalent to missing 20% of the course.)
                </p>
                <h4>Participation</h4>
                <p>Given that this course is primarily discussion based, your participation is absolutely necessary.
                    For this course, we agreed to define participation as:</p>
                <p><mark>To be determined by class discussion</mark></p>
                <p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#topLinks" class="bodylinks">Return to top</a></p>
                <h2 id="assignments">Assignments and Assessment</h2>
                <h3>My Assessment Approach</h3>
                <p>Given that this course is meant to help you become better teachers of statistics as well as
                    well as prepare you to supervise undergraduate students in a variety of situations, my
                    approach to assessment is pragmatic in nature. I am interested in your growth over the
                    semester. While a final grade will be assigned, we want you to focus on your participation
                    and reflections, not the accumulation of points.
                </p>
                <h3>Types of Assignments</h3>
                <p>For the most part, assignments in this course come in following types/flavors. All assignments are
                    meant
                    to help you get the most out of this course and to support everyone in havinga productive class
                    session.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Readings and Discussions:</strong> we will each need to read/watch the assigned
                        articles, reports, videos, chapters, etc. ahead of the scheduled class session. These
                        artifacts will be the basis for class discussions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Reflective Writings:</strong> you will be given prompts to respond. Some prompts
                        might entail summarizing class discussions, others might require you to engage in
                        self-reflection
                        and introspection. These writings will need to be submitted via Canvas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Teaching Demonstrations:</strong> each student will be asked to prepare at least one
                        teaching demonstration (details will be shared in the course). Further, I require that
                        every student participate in everyone else's teaching demonstration.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Late Submissions</h3>
                <p>Generally speaking, late submissions can have a negative impact not only on yourself but the rest
                    of our class community. Given the discussion-centered nature of this course, not completing
                    reading assignments ahead of class will greatly harm our community. We want to be the best
                    community members that we can be and support everyone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This also means that we need to be able to show and give grace to each other. We must all
                    acknowledge that sometimes unexpected things occur and can cause problems. To this end, we
                    need to keep open lines of communication. Reach out me and keep me informed of external pressures.
                    This will help us find submission times that work for people.
                </p>
                <h3>Examination Policy</h3>
                <p>This course will not have any tests or exams.</p>
                <h3>Grading Policy</h3>
                <p>
                    While there are different types of assignments, they are all equally important to your growth. Thus,
                    there no category weights.

                    The Pennsylvania State University campuses are located on the original homelands of the
                    Erie, Haudenosaunee (Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, Mohawk, and Tuscarora), Lenape
                    (Delaware Nation, Delaware Tribe, Stockbridge-Munsee), Monongahela, Shawnee (Absentee,
                    Eastern, and Oklahoma), Susquehannock, and Wahzhazhe (Osage) Nations.  As a <a href="https://www.landgrabu.org/"
                    target="_blank" class="bodylinks">land grant</a> institution, we acknowledge and honor
                    the traditional caretakers of these lands and strive to understand and model their
                    responsible stewardship. We also acknowledge the longer history of these lands and

                <h3 id="gender">Gender Identity</h3>
                <p>
                    Our institution's official policy states that "The Pennsylvania State University recognizes
                    the need or preference for members of the University community to refer to themselves by a first
                    name other than their legal first name as well as self-assert a gender other than their legal gender
                    or their gender at the time of birth (AD 84)." One way we can support self-identification is by
                    honoring the name and pronouns that each of us go by.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many people (e.g. international students, performers/writers, trans &amp; non-binary people,
                    and others) might go by a name in daily life that is different from their legal name. In this
                    classroom, we seek to refer to people by the names that they go by.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pronouns can be a way to affirm someone's gender identity, but they can also be unrelated to
                    a person's identity. They are simply a public way in which people are referred to in place of
                    their name (e.g., "he" or "she" or "they" or "ze" or something else). In this classroom, you are
                    invited (if you want to) to share what pronouns you go by, and we seek to refer to people using the
                    pronouns that they share. The pronouns someone indicates are not necessarily indicative of their
                    gender identity.

                    One of the greatest things about being human is that we are each our own unique person. As such,
                    there is a whole realm of neurodiveristy in any classroom. What some people need to have comfort
                    and success in our class will be different from those of others. We welcome all individuals from
                    across the neurodiviersity spectrum. I ask that we provide grace and space for all people to be

                <p>
                    A central aspect of education is that you build your knowledge and develop ways of thinking
                    that will support you in your life and career. As one of your educators, part of my role is
                    to assess your learning so that I can help you build the most productive ways of thinking. In
                    order for me to best help you, I need the most accurate and reliable data about your thinking
                    and learning. Academic integrity is a key to this process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A person demonstrates academic integrity when they engage in any scholarly/educational activity
                    in an open, honest, and responsible manner. This is part of our <a href="#shared-responsibilities"

                </p>
                <h3 id="ai-types">What are the different ways in which a person might violate academic integrity policies?</h3>
                <p>
                    There are many different ways in which a person's actions may directly or indirectly lead to
                    violating Academic Integrity. Keep in mind whether a person acts intentionally or accidentaly,
                    that action could still result in violating Academic Integrity. The best advice I can give is
                    to <strong>always talk with your instructors <em>before</em> you submit the assignment</strong>.
                    Here are a few of the broad categories of actions that lead to violation of academic integrity.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plagiarism:</strong> This action occurs when someone presents someone else's work as
                        their own, including their own. This can describe situations from forgetting to cite a source
                        to copying someone's work without their knowledge. Avoid plagiarism by citing your sources
                        (for figures, images, code, etc.) and giving credit to the ideas and work of others.</li>
                    <li><strong>Self-Plagarism:</strong> Self-plagiarism occurs when a person submits work that they've
                        submitted elsewhere; for example, taking a paper from one class and submitting that paper
                        (even with minor changes) for a grade in a different class without prior authorization.
                        Avoid self-plagarism by talking with your instructors about whether improving a past assignment
                        might be work for the assignment's learning objectives.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collusion:</strong> This action is similar to plagiarism but rather than one person
                        being at fault, multiple people are working together. If one person gives another the answers
                        to an assignment, that person is violating Academic Integrity just as much as the person
                        submitting the assignment. Keep in mind that collusion can happen between students who
                        aren't enrolled in the same section or even the same course. Avoid collusion by verifying
                        with your instructor from the start whether you can work with others; then be sure to give credit
                        to who did what.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ghost Writing:</strong> This action is a more consequential form of collusion. Here someone
                        does and submits work the behalf of someone else, by pretending to be this other person. Typically,
                        the ghost writer is getting some benefit (e.g., a payment) to do the work, but not always. Avoid
                        ghost writing by doing your own work; if you need assistance (e.g., typing assistance) be sure to
                        talk with your instructor and the <a href="https://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources" 
                        class="bodylinks" target="_blank">Student Disabilty Resources Office</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improper Technology Use:</strong> What qualifers as proper and improper technology usage
                        will vary from course to course. Generally, this captures any actions where technology plays a
                        central role in the violation. This spans actions such as (but not limited to) using devices
                        that aren't allowed on the assignment, using artificial intelligence systems (e.g., chatbots),
                        using messaging groups to share answers, and getting/posting answers online (e.g., sites like Chegg,
                        CourseHero, etc.). At the core of all these actions lies a person presenting someone else's work
                        as their own. Avoid using technology improperly by seeking clarification about when, how, and what
                        technologies are allowed on assignments.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The best advice I can provide is to talk with your instructor before you submit any assignment. Once
                    you submit, you've solidified your action and there isn't anything your instructor can except to
                    report the violation.
                </p>
                <p>                    
                    A person violates academic integrity when they act in a way either (dis-)advantages themselves or
                    (dis-)advantages someone else that is not explicitly allowed ahead of time. While people have a
                    variety of reasons for choosing to act in such ways (e.g., stress, lack of time, perssure to perform,
                    etc.), we need to keep in mind that choosing to violate academic integrity impacts everyone. The
                    person violating academic integrity weakens their own academic growth--they do not receive the
                    feedback that is actually necessary for their growth. The class community suffers as such cases
                    delay giving feedback, and erode the sense of trust in the community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is expected that any work submitted is your own. Class members may work on homework
                    assignments and lab assignments in groups, but each student must write up answers in their own words
                    and submit lab quizzes and homework assignments separately.
                </p>
                <h3 id="ai-differences">What are the differences between collusion, people working together, and group work?</h3>
                <p>
                    The major distinction between collusion, working together, and group work comes down to what
                    has been explicitly allowed by the instructor. Collusion is never allowed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I encourage students to <strong>work together</strong> on assignments. However, when students work
                    together, each person is individually responsible for their own work. Having one person answer the
                    questions, write the code, etc. and then pass the results to the other person is <em>not</em> working
                    together. Rather, each person should be engaged in the problems, sharing ideas, thoughts, and approaches.
                    The individual differences in how we each write and talk should be present in the answers and work each
                    person submits. Working together can enrich the learning of all those who are actively participating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Group work</strong> occurs when the instructor gives an activity or assignment that is meant
                    to be completed by a group of students together with a single submission for the group. This is not
                    a violation of academic integrity due to the specifications the instructor has set up for the assignment. 
                </p>
                <h3 id="ai-help">Where can I get help for this course?</h3>
                <p>
                    Part of learning involves running into situations where you don't instantly have a solution.
                    Rather, you have to think about the problem, try a few things, and then pieces fall into place.
                    You do not have to engage in such struggles alone. Getting help is a great way to help you engage 
                    in <em>productive struggle</em> that leads to better learning. However, not all sources of help
                    will actually support your learning and growth. Here are my suggestions for places to seek help.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Check your course notes and class recordings.</li>
                    <li>Talk with your classmates.</li>
                    <li>Make use of Student Hours.</li>
                    <li>Email your instructor.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    When you are getting help be sure that you are not crossing the line and having someone else do your
                    learning for you.
                </p>
                <h3 id="ai-chatbots">Can I use ChatBots/Generative AI in this course?</h3>
                <p>
                    Chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Bard appear confident in the answers they provide.
                    However, their answers are not always logical nor stand up to scrutiny. If a person relies upon
                    chatbots to do their work, they will miss out on critical opportunities to develop the ways of
                    thinking necessary to detect problems with AI generated answers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An important part aspect of this course is to help you develop foundational ways of thinking about
                    teaching so that you can create your own lessons. Using tools such as generative AI to design, create,
                    prepare lessons plans for you not only cheats yourself of an invaluable learning opportunity, but it
                    also cheats your students. Therefore, unless explicit permission is given for a particular assignment,
                    the entire class community (the instructor, the students, TAs, etc.) should actively refrain from using generative AI tools. When such use is explicitly authorized, that work should be properly documented. Direct usage of output from chatbots should be treated much like a direct quotation; derivations of such output should be treated as paraphrased text.

                <h3>Deferred Grades</h3>
                <p>
                    If you are prevented from completing this course within the prescribed amount of time for reasons
                    that are beyond your control, it is possible to have the grade deferred with the concurrence of the
                    instructor, following <a class="bodylinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                        href="http://senate.psu.edu/policies-and-rules-for-undergraduate-students/47-00-48-00-and-49-00-grades/#48-40">Penn
                        State Deferred Grade Policy 48-40</a>. To seek a deferred grade, you must submit a written
                    request (by e-mail or U.S. post) to the instructor describing the reason(s) for the request.
                    Non-emergency permission for filing a deferred grade must be requested before the beginning of the
                    final examination period. It is up to the instructor to determine whether or not you will be
                    permitted to receive a deferred grade. If permission is granted, you will work with the instructor
                    to establish a communication plan and a clear schedule for completion within policy. If, for any
                    reason, the coursework for the deferred grade is not complete by the assigned time, a grade of "F"
                    will be automatically entered on your transcript.

                <p>
                    In the event that I'm not able to attend class, I will send out an annoucement for what the plan will
                    be. This may include having a guest speaker/instructor (a substitute), for work time (independent or
                    in groups), or cancel the session. Such information will be announced as needed via PSU

                <p>
                    The syllabus for this course (and all other course syllabi) <em>does not</em> constitute a
                    legal contract. Further, I intend for this syllabus to change to reflect the decisions we
                    make as a community on several areas listed above as well as adapting to our needs
                    throughout the semester. Changes to the syllabus will be announced in class and updated here.
