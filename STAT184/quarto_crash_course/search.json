    "text": "1.1 Core Elements\nYAML may be interpreted as either “Yet Another Markup Language” or “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”. YAML is a programming language that typically is for writing configuration files. For a Quarto document, YAML allows us to specify several key elements including document metadata and output file specifications.\nYAML is meant to be human readable. YAML uses whitespace and indentation to structure the the code and works off a principle of key: value. The key is generally some pre-defined element that we want to pass the value to. Keep in mind that YAML is generally case sensitive.\nWhen working with YAML in a Quarto document, a good practice is to make sure that the YAML header is at the very top of the QMD file. Further, the YAML header needs to begin and end with lines that contain just three dashes: ---.\nThe following code block (Listing 1.1) shows the YAML header that was used for the first version of this book (back when it was a single webpage).\nThe title, subtitle, author, date, and date-modified keys all provide meta-data for the Quarto document.\nThe format key starts the specifications for how the output files will get generated. In Listing 1.1, I’m customizing the html output with additional keys including using section numbering, including a table of contents (toc), and controlling how figures and captions should appear by default. For HTML documents, you can also specify how links should work; here I’m making sure that they open up in new tabs/windows instead of replacing this guide.\nNotice that the the html key is indented in two spaces from the format key and then the sub-keys to html are indented a further two spaces in Listing 1.1. When you are working with sub-keys you need to make sure that you use indentation to help communicate that structure in your YAML code.\nThe last set of keys that starts with the execute control the defaults for code chunks. Here, I’ve set the code chunks to not print themselves (i.e., echo) and to suppress any warning messages.",

    "section": "1.2 Examples",
    "text": "1.2 Examples\nThe following examples provide you with some starter YAML headers. You can customize these as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nALWAYS check with your course instructor or supervisor for what output file and formatting they want.\n\n\n\n1.2.1 Using Default Output Formats\nTaking a moment to think through what type of output format(s) you want is always a good thing. This fits with the Planning stage of the PCIP System. If the default file formats are all you want, then you can simplify your YAML header. Here are the key: value pairs of the three common default output file types:\n\nHTML: format: html\nPDF: format: pdf\nWord Doc: format: docx\n\nIf you want Quarto to create multiple output file types from the same document, you use the format key to do this. Listing 1.2 shows a basic example for creating three different output files from one Quarto document.\n\n\n\nListing 1.2: Multi-output YAML Example\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Example Document\"\nformat:\n  html: default\n  pdf: default\n  docx: default\n---\n\n\n\nWhen specifying multiple output files, you will need to set each output type on their own line and use the default value if you are not otherwise specifying additional formatting guides. You can combine the following examples along with the Listing 1.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen creating multiple output files from a single Quarto document, the Render button of RStudio Desktop will only create the first listed output. However, you can use the Terminal to have Quarto generate all output formats. You will either need to make sure that the Terminal is pointed to the folder that your QMD file is in OR provide the full file path. Then, all you need to do is run the following code:\nquarto render exampleQuarto.qmd.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 HTML w/Code Appendix\nIf you are planning on including a code appendix (see Chapter 9) in your document, then you do not need to show the code in the body of your document. The following YAML header example (Listing 1.3) serves as a good starting point for HTML output in such a situation.\n\n\n\nListing 1.3: Recommended YAML Header for HTML Output Format w/Code Appendix\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Informative Title\"\nauthor: \"List All Authors\"\ndate: \"Dec. 3, 2024\"\ndate-modified: now\nformat: \n  html:\n    embed-resources: true\n    number-sections: true\n    toc: true\n    toc-depth: 4\n    toc-location: right\n    fig-align: center\n    cap-location: top\n    link-external-newwindow: true\nexecute: \n  echo: false\n  warning: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 HTML w/Code Folding\nIn the event that you are not including a code appendix or you want to allow users to see code chunks in context, then you should set up code folding. This example (Listing 1.4) will give a good starting point for that.\n\n\n\nListing 1.4: Recommended YAML Header for HTML Output Format w/Code Folding\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Informative Title\"\nauthor: \"List All Authors\"\ndate: \"Dec. 3, 2024\"\ndate-modified: now\nformat: \n  html:\n    embed-resources: true\n    number-sections: true\n    toc: true\n    toc-depth: 4\n    toc-location: right\n    fig-align: center\n    cap-location: top\n    link-external-newwindow: true\n    code-fold: true\nexecute: \n  warning: false\n---\n\n\n\nNotice that you’ll need to add the code-fold key AND remove the echo key.\n\n\n1.2.4 PDF\nGenerally, if you are making a report as a PDF, your code should appear in an appendix at the end of the document, not in the body of your report.\n\n\n\nListing 1.5: Recommend YAML Header for PDF Output\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Informative Title\"\nauthor: \"List All Authors\"\ndate: \"Dec. 3, 2024\"\ndate-modified: now\nformat: \n  pdf: \n    toc: false\n    number-sections: true\n    number-depth: 5\n    fig-align: center\n    cap-location: top\n    geometry: \n      - top=1in\n      - left=1in\n      - right=1in\n      - bottom=1in\n    colorlinks: true\nexecute: \n  echo: false\n  warning: false\n---\n\n\n\nWhen creating a PDF, always check to see if you need a Table of Contents and adjust the toc key’s value as appropriate (Listing 1.5). The geometry key allows you define the page margins. Here, I’ve used 1-inch margins on all sides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionLaTeX Needed\n\n\n\nIf you are creating a PDF from a Quarto document, you’ll need to have LaTeX installed on your computer. The easiest way to do this is to use TinyTex. The {tinytex} R package will help you install the necessary components.\n\n\n\n\nListing 1.6: R Code for Setting Up TinyTex\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"tinytex\")\nlibrary(tinytex)\ninstall_tinytex()\n\n\n\n\nRunning the commands shown in Listing 1.6 in your Console will trigger a process to get LaTeX installed and configured for rendering Quarto documents to PDF. Be sure to follow the prompts as they come up. Keep in mind that the first time you render to a PDF, the process will take a bit longer than usual.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.5 Word\nWhen going to a Microsoft Word document (*.docx), you’ll want to make sure that you do a careful look through the rendered output file to make sure that everything appears how you intended. Be prepared for the need to make adjustments. Listing 1.7 shows a recommended YAML Header.\n\n\n\nListing 1.7: Recommend YAML Header for Word Document Output\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Informative Title\"\nauthor: \"List All Authors\"\ndate: \"Dec. 3, 2024\"\ndate-modified: now\nformat: \n  docx: \n    toc: false\n    toc-depth: 5\n    number-sections: true\n    number-depth: 5\n    page-width: 6.5\n    fig-align: center\n    fig-dpi: 300\nexecute: \n  echo: false\n  warning: false\n---\n\n\n\nAs with PDFs, always check to see if a Table of Contents is needed. The page-width key is how you’ll specify the left/right margins (symmetric) for the document. A new key to be sure to set is fig-dpi; this controls the resolution of graphics. Set this too low and your visualizations will appear grainy/fuzzy. The recommendation is to use at least 300.\nAn additional caution with Word is to check any tables you created. If you are using styling commands from the {kableExtra} package, the tables may not be rendered correctly. You can either switch to another package such as {flextable} or fix the tables in Word.",

    "section": "1.4 More with the author Key",
    "text": "1.4 More with the author Key\nYAML allows us some additional flexibility with the author key. Namely, we can use either author or authors as our key and Quarto will know what to do. This allows us to incorporate multiple authors in our report as well as add information about them.\n\n1.4.1 Multiple Authors\nThere are several ways that we can incorporate multiple authors into our Quarto document’s YAML Header. The easiest approach is to just give all authors as a string such as what is shown in Listing 1.8.\n\n\n\nListing 1.8: Multiple Authors as Single String\n\n\n---\nauthors: \"Neil J. Hatfield, Veronica Bubb, and Matthew Beckman\"\n---\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can make use of nesting structure of YAML to list each author on their own line. This is shown in Listing 1.9\n\n\n\nListing 1.9: Nested Listing of Authors\n\n\n---\nauthors: \n  - Neil J. Hatfield\n  - Veronica Bubb\n  - Matthew Beckman\n---\n\n\n\nNotice that we didn’t enclose the names in quotation marks in Listing 1.9. This is a place where you can safely omit the quotation marks.\nThe major difference between the approaches of Listing 1.8 and Listing 1.9 is how the names appear in the rendered document. For HTML outputs, Listing 1.8 results in all of the names appearing on the same line (as if they are just one name). For Listing 1.9, they will appear as a vertical list in HTML formats with each author getting their own line.\nWhile the choice is really up to you, using the nesting structure of YAML allows us to also add metadata for each author.\n\n\n1.4.2 Author Metadata\nWe can leverage YAML to include important metadata for each author on the document. This can include additional information such as\n\nContact info (e.g., email, phone)\nAffiliations\nDegrees\nRoles (see Chapter 7 for more information)\nORCiD\n\nYou don’t have to specify every possible bit of author metadata nor do you have to specify the same metadata for each author. Listing 1.10 provides an example of incorporating author metadata for multiple authors.\n\n\n\nListing 1.10: YAML Header for Author Metadata\n\n\n---\nauthors: \n  - name: Neil J. Hatfield\n    orcid: 0000-0003-1807-6946\n    corresponding: true\n    email: neil.hatfield@psu.edu\n    role:\n      - conceptualization\n      - project administration\n      - supervision\n      - writing - original draft\n      - writing - review & editing\n    affiliations: \n      - id: psu\n        name: The Pennsylvania State University\n        city: University Park\n        state: PA\n        country: USA\n  - name: Veronica Bubb\n    role:\n      - formal analysis\n      - methodology\n      - visualization\n      - writing - original draft\n      - writing - review & editing\n    affiliations: \n      - ref: psu\n  - name: Matthew Beckman\n    role:\n      - data curation\n      - formal analysis\n      - resources\n      - visualization\n      - writing - original draft\n      - writing - review & editing\n    affiliations: \n      - ref: psu\n---\n\n\n\nThere are a couple of important pieces to notice with the nesting structure:\n\nEach author is on a line that starts with an en-dash (i.e., -) that is is two spaces from the left edge. This is immediately followed by the name key and the appropriate value.\nEach piece of additional information about that person appears on a new line below the name WITHOUT an en-dash. Each subsequent line is four spaces from the left so that the metadata keys line up.\nIf a piece of metadata has multiple values (e.g., role and affiliations), then those values get nested inside those keys with additional spaces and en-dashes.\n\nTo read more about author metadata, check out Quarto’s Author and Affiliations page.\nThere’s a lot more to YAML headers, all depending on what you’re wanting to create. You can learn more within Quarto’s many guides.",

    "text": "2.1 Inline Code\nThere are two ways that you can use programming languages in Quarto documents. You can run (simple) commands inline or you can write code chunks.\nInline code is great for reporting a value that you have stored in the environment, to do a quick calculation, or something else that is simple. To create some inline code, you’ll need to start with a backtick (or grave), `, the symbol located on the key just to the left of the 1 key. This will start your code; you’ll close the code with another instance of the backtick, `. You’ll need to type a lower case r right after the first backtick to state what language your code is supposed to be (in this case R). For example, ` r 1 + 2 ` will yield 3. Notice that inline code is evaluated and the result is displayed.\nInline code will automatically be run when you render the document.",

    "section": "2.2 Code Chunks",
    "text": "2.2 Code Chunks\nCode chunks are much larger blocks where you can do more complicated things. For example, you can use code chunks to import a picture, load and clean data, create data visualizations, tables, and run models, etc.\nYou can add a code chunk manually by typing three backticks in a row on new line. When you’re finished with the chunk, you type another three backticks. In the first line, just after the three backticks, you need to include a set of curly braces and list the programming language for the code. For instance {r}. All of your code should be on lines in between these two lines as well as any chunk options. Listing 2.1 shows how you should set up a code chunk for R in a Quarto document. In RStudio Desktop, you can also use the insert code chunk button (looks like a green square with a plus sign and the letter C) and select R to get a code chunk. Alternatively you can also use the keyboard shortcut Command + Option + i (Mac) or Ctrl + Alt + i (Windows).\n\n\n\n\nListing 2.1: Formatting a Code Chunk for R\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: exampleCode1\n#| lst-label: lst-exampleChunk\n#| lst-cap: \"Formatting a Code Chunk for R\"\n#| eval: false\n\n# A First Example Code Chunk ---\n1 + 1\n```\n\n\n\n\nThe four lines that start with #| list out the code chunk options. These follow the YAML structure of key: value. These code chunk options allow you to grant format exceptions from default as well as configure figure size, captions, and position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningWarning on eval and include Keys\n\n\n\nBe cautious of the eval and include keys. The eval key controls whether or not the code chunk will run during rendering; the include key controls whether the output of the code will get included in the rendered document (the code still runs).\n\n\nYou can execute (run) code chunks individually by clicking the play button located in the upper-right corner of each chunk. This will display the output of the code in a collapsible window below the chunk. Keep in mind that when you run code this way, it references your current environment for items.\nWhen you render a Quarto document, R will create a new environment that is separate from your local environment and run all of the code fresh. The results of that run will be what get put into the output file(s).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantPitfall: Relying on Local Environment\n\n\n\nA common issue students run into when working with Quarto is forgetting that rendering creates a new environment. They will often load data to their local environment but not have any code in their Quarto document that loads the data. Thus, when they render their Quarto file, their code fails as objects are missing.\n\n\nCode chunks can be run individually by clicking the play button located in the upper right corner of each chunk. This should display the output of the code chunk in a collapsible window below the code. All code chunks will run when you knit/render the document unless you’ve specified otherwise as a chunk option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipBest Practice\n\n\n\nA best practice to follow when working with Quarto documents is to make each code chunk dedicated to ONE task. That is, each code chunk is really only meant to cover one thing. For example, one code chunk should be used to load all of your needed packages and set global options. A second code chunk should load your data, while a third deals with any particular cleaning. Each data visualization (plots, graphs, and tables) should get their own chunk.\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Formating Your Code Chunks\nWhen setting up a code chunk, there are some steps you should take to ensure that your code chunk is in good shape.\n\nLeave an empty line before and after you make the code chunk. That is, there should be an empty line your QMD file immediately before and after the opening and closing set of three backticks (i.e., ```).\nImmediately after the opening three backticks, you need to specify the language of the code chunk in a set of curly braces. For example, ```{r}.\nCode chunk options should be listed at the top of the code chunk. There should be no empty lines between the start of the code chunk and the chunk options.\nEach code chunk option gets its own line and should begin with #|. There should be a single space between the vertical pipe symbol and the first letter of the option key.\nCode chunk options are essentially YAML key: value pairs.\nThe label for a code chunk should be unique (no duplicates allowed in the document). Avoid using underscores in the label value. See Chapter 6 for additional information.\nLeave an empty line between your last code chunk option and the start of your code.\nUse code comments to help structure your code. These will become invaluable when someone looks at your Code Appendix.\nLeave an empty space between your last line of code and the closing three backticks. This will help create spacing for your Code Appendix.",

    "section": "2.3 Using Multiple Coding Languages",
    "text": "2.3 Using Multiple Coding Languages\nOne of the powerful aspects of Quarto documents is that they support multiple programming languages within the same document. Currently, Quarto supports R, Python, Julia, and Observable JavaScript for computations. Quarto also understands HTML, YAML, CSS, and SQL (via the {knitr} R package).\nKeep in mind that if you are going to use multiple programming languages in the same document, you must have the appropriate engines installed on your machine. That is, you need to have a Python installation if you plan to run Python code; R if you plan to run R code, etc.\nFor Python, you’ll need to install the jupyter package. For details, check out the Using Python page of Quarto (Using Python, n.d.). You will also need to add the key: value pair jupyter: python3 to your YAML header or to the code chunk as shown in Listing 2.2.\nListing 2.2 shows an example code chunk that uses Python instead of R with in the Quarto document that makes this webpage.\n\n\n\n\nListing 2.2: An example of a python code chunk\n\n\n```{python}\n#| jupyter: python3\n#| lst-label: lst-python\n#| lst-cap: \"An example of a python code chunk\"\n\n# An example python code chunk ----\nprefix = \"Stat\"\nnum = 184\n\nstatement = \"Welcome to {} {}!\".format(prefix, num)\nprint(statement)\n```\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to Stat 184!\n\n\nOne of the most powerful aspects of a multi-programming language document is that you can use different languages for different tasks, playing to the strengths of the tasks. In Quarto, you can pass variables between Python and R. When rendering your Quarto document to objects will get created: py and r. The py object contains all of your Python variables while r contains all of your R variables. This means that you can access and change elements using the appropriate extractor operator: $ in R and . in Python.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that you still need to have all of the packages you need already installed for all programming languages you are using in a Quarto document. Additionally, there may still be instances where communication errors occur. Get in the habit of regularly testing and rendering the full document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nListing 2.3: Calling a Python Object in R Code Chunk\n\n\n```{r}\n#| lst-label: lst-py2R\n#| lst-cap: \"Calling a Python Object in R Code Chunk\"\n# Example of Call Python object in R Chunk ----\nlibrary(reticulate)\ncapStatement &lt;- stringr::str_to_upper(py$statement)\nprint(capStatement)\n\n# Create new R objects for next example ----\nmainPart &lt;- runif(n = 5, min = 50, max = 80)\nerrorPart &lt;- rnorm(n = 5, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n```\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"WELCOME TO STAT 184!\"\n\n\nIn Listing 2.3, you’ll notice that we needed to load the {reticulate} R package. This package needs to be loaded just once in your Quarto document to facilitate passing objects between the two languages.\n\n\n\n\nListing 2.4: Calling R Objects in Python Code Chunk\n\n\n```{python}\n#| jupyter: python3\n#| lst-label: lst-R2py\n#| lst-cap: \"Calling R Objects in Python Code Chunk\"\n# Example of Calling R objects in Python ----\nnewValues = [sum(x) for x in zip(r.mainPart, r.errorPart)]\nroundedValues = [round(x, 3) for x in newValues]\nprint(roundedValues)\n```\n\n\n\n\n[73.8, 61.214, 53.785, 56.772, 74.828]\n\n\nSimilarly, we can access and work with R objects in Python chunks (see Listing 2.4).\n\n\n\n\nUsing Python.

For this guide, I’m going to show how to format your text when you are in the Source view of a Quarto document. (This approach will also work if you are using another IDE that doesn’t support a visual editor.) Your formatting draws upon Markdown syntax.\nMany students often think about headings as being a stylistic element and to a certain extent this is true. However, headings also serve an important structural purpose: headings help readers build their sense of how the different parts of the document connect to each other in a hierarchical fashion. Throughout this guide, I’ve been using (numbered) headings to communicate the guide’s structure and help you get a sense of what each section might be about.\nSection headings are essentially hashtags. That is, they are short, descriptive phrases that start with one or more hash signs (a.k.a. pound signs, octothropes). The number of hashes you place at the start of the line will determine the heading level. One hash gives Heading Level 1; two will give Heading Level 2, etc. If you used the number-sections: true in your YMAL header, the Heading Level controls the automatic numbering of your sections.\nKeep in mind that just like hashtags, section headings are not meant to be full sentences and definitely not supposed to multiple lines long. Unlike hashtags that you find online, you will want to put spaces between words and use the appropriate case (Title, Sentence) for your document style (e.g., APA). There should be a space between the hashes and the first word of the heading.\nSection headings follow a hierarchy with Heading Level 1 being the top level; Heading Level 2 is the next level down, and so forth. While you can get down to Heading Levels 5 and 6, please try to keep these to a minimum. We also do not want to skip any levels. That is, don’t use a Heading Level 3 after a Heading Level 1 but not have anything that is a Heading Level 2. This is as much for ensuring the accessibility of your document as well as helping to make sure that the auto-numbering makes sense to your readers.",

    "text": "3.2 Styling Text\nBeyond creating headings, we can also style text. The most common text styling includes italics, boldface, creating lists, and adding links.\n\n3.2.1 Italicizing Text\nThe most common usages of italics are when you are introducing a key term for the first time or when you want to add emphasis to a word or phrase. To italicize a word or phrase, you’ll need to place a single asterisk, *, on both sides of the word/phrase. For example, *sample arithmetic mean* will get rendered as sample arithmetic mean in the render/knitted document.\n\n\n3.2.2 Bolding Text\nBoldface text also places emphasis on a word or phrase and can be used to call out particular words or phrases in your writing. To make a word or phrase bold, you’ll need to type two underscores. _ _ (with no space between them) on both sides of the word/phrase. For example, _ _ NASA_ _ becomes NASA in the final output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn Markdown you can also use two asterisks on either side of a term to get boldface. For example, **NASA** will also make NASA.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Lists\nThere are several different kinds of lists but the two most common are bulleted (a.k.a. unordered lists) and numbered (a.k.a. ordered lists). The major difference between the two is whether you want to convey to the reader that list elements need to be done in a specific order (i.e., ordered lists) or in any order (i.e., unordered lists).\nTo create a list, you’ll want to move down two lines from you preceding narrative text and then type either a dash (-) for unordered lists or a numeral followed by a period (e.g., 1.) for ordered lists. You will want to have an empty line after the last element in your list before starting your next block of test. Here are two examples.\n\nApples\nOranges\nBananas\n\n\nWake up\nHave breakfast\nGet ready for the day\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Links\nYou can add links to your text (as appropriate) by enclosing the link text in square brackets ([ and ]) and then immediately placing the URL link inside a set of parentheses after the last square braket (no spaces). For example, the text “[Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)” will get rendered as Markdown Cheat Sheet (Markdown Cheat Sheet | Markdown Guide, n.d.).\nIf you want to see further ways to style text, check out the aforementioned Markdown cheat sheet.",

    "section": "3.3 Writing Mathematics",
    "text": "3.3 Writing Mathematics\nWhen working in quantitative fields like Statistics and Data Science, we often find ourselves needing to type mathematical expressions or formula. Quarto allows us to include mathematics in our narrative text in one of two formats: inline math and display math.\n\n3.3.1 Inline Mathematics\nInline mathematics is meant to be displayed as part of a regular sentence. For example, we might want to report that some random variable follows a Gaussian distribution with mean \\(\\mu=70\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2=4.2\\).\nStart your inline mathematical expression by typing a single dollar sign, $, followed by your expression; end your expression with another dollar sign, $. For example, $y=x^2+\\frac{3}{4}$ will become \\(y=x^2+\\frac{3}{4}\\).\nIf done correctly, the starting and ending dollar signs should appear as red text in the RStudio Desktop IDE Source view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNeed to type a dollar sign without triggering a math expression? Just preceed the dollar sign with a backslash. For example, \\ $ (no space). This also works on other Markdown symbols such as the asterisk and underscore.\n\n\n\n3.3.1.1 Greek Characters\nWhile it might be tempting to use HTML entities for Greek characters (e.g., &mu;) or those found from keyboard shortcuts (e.g., µ), you need to do so with some caution. The HTML entities will only appear in the HTML output. The keyboard shortcut generated symbols may cause the Quarto document to fail to render (especially to PDF). The best practice is to use inline mathematics for Greek characters.\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Display Mathematics\nDisplay mathematics is for when you want to the mathematical expression to be centered on its own line. We use this when we really want to emphasize the formula.\nTo create display equations (centered on their own line), use two dollar signs to begin and end the expression. Thus, $ $y=x^2+\\frac{3}{4}$ $ (no space between the dollar signs) will become \\[y=x^2+\\frac{3}{4}\\]\n\n3.3.2.1 Align Environment and Multiple Lines\nIf you need to create mathematical expressions that span multiple lines, you can use the align environment inside a display math mode. For example,\n\\begin{align*}\nH_0&: y = \\mu_{\\bullet\\bullet} + \\epsilon_{ij}\\\\\nH_1&: y = \\mu\\_{\\bullet\\bullet} + \\alpha_{i} + \\epsilon_{ij}\\\\\nend{align*}\nwill become\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nH_0&: y = \\mu_{\\bullet\\bullet} + \\epsilon_{ij}\\\\\nH_1&: y = \\mu_{\\bullet\\bullet} + \\alpha_{i} + \\epsilon_{ij}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe ampersand, &, tells LaTeX to use align the lines that point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe math display system in Quarto is connected to LaTeX (TeX). If you are familiar with that system, you can draw upon that knowledge. If you’re new to typing mathematics, no worries. Overleaf (n.d.) has a handy guide of Greek characters and mathematical symbols as well as a bunch of other math guides you can draw from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Cheat Sheet | Markdown Guide.

Notice that the first option is label and that the value starts with fig-. This will allow me to reference this plot in the body of my document. The fig-cap option is what sets the caption. If you used the title argument of the labs function, you would move the text string from title to tbl-cap. There is no need to use both a caption and a title.\nSimilar to tables, when you render to PDF or Word (or other formats with actual pages), Quarto will occasionally move the figure around. The fig-pos option will override this just like tbl-pos does. The other two options to play around with are fig-height and fig-width. These control the height and width of the figure, respectively. The number given is interpreted as a number of inches. You’ll notice in Listing 5.1 that I only specified fig-height. I recommend that you only set one of height or width and let the computer scale the other dimension.

    "text": "5.3 Alt Text and Long Descriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteRequired Starting Fall 2025\n\n\n\nYou are required to include alt text (or long descriptions) for your course project as such practices make your reports more inclusive and accessible–principles at the heart of Open Science.\n\n\nAs we discussed in class, knowing how to add alt text to any figure, including plots and graphs, will put you ahead of the curve. As a reminder, we talked about two tools that can help you in this endeavor.\n\nASU’s Image Accessiblity AI Tool\n\nUpload your image, optionally add context, and then review the generated Alt Text and Long Description.\n\nThe {BrailleR} Package\n\nFor several plots created with {ggplot2}, you can generate an initial Long Description.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantAlways Review\n\n\n\nMake sure that you review the generated Alt Text and Long Description when using these tools and adjust as necessary. These tools can and do make mistakes.\n\n\nReturning to Listing 5.1, we can see two options that are for image accessibility for HTML outputs: fig-alt and aria-describedby. (They will be ignored when rendering to anything else.) When creating a web files, you should always include Alt Text on visualizations. You can learn more about Alt Text at Penn State’s Accessibility page Image ALT Text (2014).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipBest Practice\n\n\n\nRemember that alt text should describe to what is actually shown and only be ~140 characters long.\n\n\n\n5.3.1 Setting the fig-alt Option Manually\nThe easiest approach to attaching alt text to your plot/graph is to use the fig-alt option as shown in Listing 5.1. As you’re setting the code chunk options for your plot, you can specify the fig-alt option and give a character string (make sure to use quotation marks!). Listing 5.2 provides a focused look at the key option that you will need to use for adding alt text to a graph or plot.\n\n\n\nListing 5.2: Example Setting Alt Text Manually\n\n\n#| label: fig-diamondsBox\n#| fig-cap: \"Box plot of Diamond Mass\"\n#| fig-alt: \"A box plot of diamond mass showing positive skewness with a median of 0.7 carats, streching to a max of about 5 carats.\"\n\n# [Code for making a box plot of diamond masses]\n\n\n\nNotice that the values for the keys fig-cap and fig-alt are not the same. Figure captions essentially function as a plot title. If you are using an image that someone else made, you also cite the source as part of the caption (and never part of the alt text). Your alt text needs to describe the plot in a useful, but concise manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionWrapped Text\n\n\n\nBe careful when copying the example in Listing 5.2; I’ve told Quarto to automatically wrap code lines. Thus, the alt text does not actually consist of two lines; just one.\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Using the alt label of {ggplot2}\nRemember that the labs function from {ggplot2} has an alt argument that you can use. This will link alt text to the plot at the moment of creation. One potential benefit to using this alt argument is its ability have incorporate R variables and functions. Listing 5.3 gives an example of using the alt argument to re-create the alt text found in Listing 5.2. Using functions as part of your alt text allows for the alt text to become automatically update-able. If we were to alter the data in the diamonds data frame and then re-render our Quarto file, our alt text here would update.\n\n\n\n\nListing 5.3: Code Chunking Showing Use of the alt Argument\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-diamondBox\n#| fig-alt: !expr get_alt_text(get_last_plot())\n#| fig-height: 2\n#| aria-describedby: diamondBoxLD\n#| lst-label: lst-altText2\n#| lst-cap: \"Code Chunking Showing Use of the alt Argument\"\n\nggplot(\n  data = diamonds,\n  mapping = aes(x = carat)\n) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Mass (ct)\",\n    alt = paste(\"A box plot of diamond mass showing positive skewness with a median of\", median(diamonds$carat), \"carats, streching to a max of about\", max(diamonds$carat), \"carats.\")\n  ) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y = element_blank()\n  )\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Long Description\n    The hoizontal axis is labelled 'Mass (ct)' and goes from 0 to a little past 5 with labels at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n    The box plot is arranged horizontally and shows positive skewness.\n    The lower whisker starts at 0.2, the value of the Sample Minimum, and extends to the first quartile, 0.4. The box is roughly symmetric, with the mid-line occuring at 0.7, the value of the Sample Median, and the third quartile at 1.04. The upper whisker extends to the upper hinge of about 2.\n    There are 1889 cases with masses greater than the upper hinge, getting marked as 'outsiders'. The largest of these is 5.01, the value of the Sample Maximum.\n\nIn order for us to make use of the text we’ve stored in the alt argument of labs and apply it to the fig-alt key, we have to make use of a couple of functions from {ggplot2}. First, we will need to use the get_alt_text function to extract the value of alt. Second, to give the appropriate input to this function we’ll use the get_last_plot function. This will grab the last plot that was rendered and treat it as the input we desire.\nThe last step is to use !expr as the start to our value for the fig-alt key. This is a YAML tag literal that will allow the knitr engine to run the two functions listed after this start.\nAs a second example, check out Listing 5.4, which will create a histogram of randomly sampled values from a Gaussian distribution with Expected Value of 0 and Variance of 1 (Figure 5.3).\n\n\n\n\nListing 5.4: Code Chunk Showing Extracting Alt Text\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-simpleHist\n#| fig-cap: \"Random Sample from Gaussian Distribution\"\n#| fig-pos: H\n#| fig-height: 5\n#| fig-alt: !expr get_alt_text(get_last_plot())\n#| aria-describedby: simpleHistLD\n#| lst-label: lst-figure2\n#| lst-cap: \"Code Chunk Showing Extracting Alt Text\"\n\n# Additional plot showing how to extract the alt text from the plot ----\nggplot(\n  data = data.frame(values = rnorm(50, mean = 0, sd = 1)),\n  mapping = aes(x = values)\n) +\n  geom_histogram(\n    color = \"black\",\n    fill = \"blue\",\n    binwidth = 0.25,\n    closed = \"left\",\n    boundary = 0\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Observed values\",\n    y = \"Freq.\",\n    alt = \"Histogram of 50 randomly sampled values from a Gaussian distribution that is symmetric, bell-shaped, and centered around zero.\"\n  ) +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Random Sample from Gaussian Distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Long Description\n    The horizontal axis is labelled 'Observed values' and goes from -3 to 3 with labels of -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 and 3.\n    The vertical axis is labelled 'Freq.' and goes from 0 to 8 with labels of 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8.\n    The bar chart has 23 vertical bars, each 0.25 units wide. The first bar starts at -3 and the last bar ends at 2.75.\n    The outer bars are relatively short with the bars in the middle being the tallest. The tallest bar covers -0.25 to 0 and has a height of 8.\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Adding Long Descriptions\nWe also talked about using Long Descriptions with our plots/graphs. The ASU Image Accessibility tool and the {BrailleR} package can generate these descriptions for you. The best thing you can do is incorporate these into your narrative text, and use cross-references to connect the descriptions and figure. You can learn more about Long Descriptions at Penn State’s Accessibility page Long Description (2015).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipBest Practice\n\n\n\nUse the description generated by the {BrailleR} package or by the ASU tool as a starting point. You should refine and improve upon the text that was generated as you work on your narrative. Your narrative description should appear close to your figure and make use of cross-referencing (see Chapter 6).\n\n\n\n5.3.3.1 Long Descriptions and HTML Documents\nWhen we work with HTML documents, like this guide, we have a few additional options at our disposal when working with long descriptions. This includes leveraging ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Application) roles and attributes. If you look back at Listing 5.1, Listing 5.3, and Listing 5.4, you’ll see that I used the key aria-describedby as part of the code chunk options. This sets up a connection between the plot the “Long Description” that appears under each one. These are set up as special disclosure elements where the long descriptions are housed.\nThis approach allows you to separate your long descriptions from your narrative text. This lets you focus your narrative on the most important aspects of the data visualization while keeping a full description of the plot.\nCreating these types of elements and making sure that they are appropriately linked for screen-readers is beyond Stat 184. If you are interested in learning how to make them, contact me and I’ll show you how.",

    "text": "5.4 Multi-pane Visualizations\nWhen you want people to compare data across different data visualizations, proximity is important. That is, you don’t want a person to have to flip more than a page to compare the data visualizations. One common strategy is to put the data visualizations together into one figure. In Quarto there are two ways that we can do this, both of which use a single code chunk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantPlots/Graphs or Tables, Not Both\n\n\n\nAny code chunk you make in your Quarto document for a data visualization should either be for a plot/graph or for a table. You should not use the same chunk to house the code for both of these two types of data visualizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSingle Tables\n\n\n\nGenerally speaking, you should only put one table in a code chunk. This is one way in which tables are different from plots/graphs. If you need to put several tables next to or near each other, just put their individual code chunks near one another and use the tbl-pos key with the value H.\n\n\n\n5.4.1 Faceting\nThe first approach that we can use to create multi-pane plots/graphs, is through the power of faceting. This is the idea of making a set of “small multiples” of the same style of graph. The {ggplot2} package provides us with two functions that help us achieve this with a single ggplot call:\n\nfacet_wrap: Create a ribbon of plots that flows from one row to the next, with each plot being a column.\nfacet_grid: Create a rectangular display of plots.\n\nFigure 5.4 provides a way to think about how these two functions end up arranging the plots. We can think about the grid layout as working like an Excel spreadsheet: the columns specify one set of groupings while rows specify a second set of groupings.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Grid vs. Wrap Layout (Wickham et al., n.d.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is different from wrapping, which moves sequentially left-to-right through your specified number of columns before moving down to the next row.\nAnother way you can think about the difference between these two faceting functions to ask yourself how many case attributes you want to use to create small multiples. If you only want to use a single attribute, use facet_wrap; if you want to use two, use facet_grid.\n\n5.4.1.1 Alt Text and Long Descriptions\nWhen faceting, you will need to be careful with your alt text and long descriptions. You only get ONE alt text for the entire faceted set of plots. Thus, your alt text is going to more general than you might otherwise use. Thus, your long description is going to have to be more robust, covering every facet of your multi-pane plot/graph.\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Sub-Figures\nAlternatively, suppose that you want to put different types of plots next to each other AND make sure that each one gets an appropriate label. This is the idea of creating sub-figures and is different from faceting. Faceting is essentially one plot that is broken up into several smaller pieces; sub-figures are entirely separate plots that are just bound together into one figure environment.\nWhen creating a figure composed of several sub-figures, you need to keep in mind that you will have\n\nOne code chunk for the entire set of sub-figures.\nOne label with the fig- prefix for the entire set.\nOne Caption covering the entire set (i.e., fig-cap).\nMultiple sub-captions, one for each sub-figure.\nMultiple alt text, one for each sub-figure.\nThought about how many columns (or rows) you want to use to arrange the sub-figures.\nAnd the code to create each of the plots that make up all of the sub-figures.\n\nWith these in mind, we can go about creating a figure composed of sub-figures. Listing 5.5 shows the first part of the single code chunk that we’ll use; in particular the code chunk options. Notice that we only have one label and one fig-cap. Under the fig-subcap key, we’ll use YAML nesting with the en-dash (i.e., -) to denote the sub-captions to be applied to each sub-figure. For alt text, we’ll use the same strategy of YAML nesting. The layout-ncol key allows us to specify how many columns we want to use. Alternatively, you can use layout-nrow to specify the number of rows. I would not recommend using both. If you want even more control, you can use the layout; see Custom Layout for an example.\n\n\n\nListing 5.5: Code Chunk Showing Creating Sub-Figures\n\n\n#| label: fig-subFigures\n#| fig-cap: \"Random Samples of Size 50 from Different Distributions\"\n#| fig-subcap: \n#|   - \"Gaussian, $\\\\mu=0$, $\\\\sigma^2=1$\"\n#|   - \"Exponential, $\\\\lambda=1$\"\n#|   - \"Beta, $\\\\alpha=1$, $\\\\beta=3$\"\n#| fig-alt:\n#|   - \"Histogram of 50 randomly sampled values from a Gaussian distribution that is symmetric, bell-shaped, and centered around zero.\"\n#|   - \"Histogram of 50 randomly sampled values from a Exponential distribution, showing positive skewness.\"\n#|   - \"Histogram of 50 randomly sampled values from a Beta distribution with slight positive skewness.\"\n#| layout-ncol: 2\n#| aria-describedby: subFiguresLD\n\n# Creating a Figure with Sub-figures ----\n## Code for the first sub-figure ----\n# [Code omitted]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Random Samples of Size 50 from Different Distributions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Gaussian, \\(\\mu=0\\), \\(\\sigma^2=1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Exponential, \\(\\lambda=1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Beta, \\(\\alpha=1\\), \\(\\beta=3\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Long Description\n    This is a set of three plots of 50 randomly sampled values from three different distributions, in a 2 by 2 grid. The distributions include a Gaussian, an Exponential, and a Beta. Each plot will be described in order left-to-right, top-to-bottom.\n    In the upper left is a Gaussian distribution with an Expected Value of 0 and Variance of 1.\n    The horizontal axis is labelled 'Observed values' and goes from about -3 to 2.25 with labels of -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2.\n    The vertical axis is labelled 'Freq.' and goes from 0 to 7 with labels of 0, 2, 4, and 6.\n    The bar chart has 16 vertical bars, each 0.25 units wide. The first bar starts at -2.75 and the last bar ends at 2.\n    The outer bars are relatively short with the bars in the middle being the tallest. The tallest bar covers 0 to 0.25 and has a height of 7.\n    In the upper right is an Exponential distribution with an Expected Value of 1.\n    The horizontal axis is labelled 'Observed values' and goes from about 0 to 4.25 with labels of  0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    The vertical axis is labelled 'Freq.' and goes from 0 to 11.5 with labels of 0, 3, 6, and 9.\n    The bar chart has 14 vertical bars, each 0.25 units wide. The first bar starts at 0 and the last bar ends at 4.\n    The tallest bars are to the left (towards 0) with the bars getting shorter as they approach 4 The tallest bar is for the interval 0 to 0.25 and has a height of 11.\n    In the lower left is a Beta distribution with an Alpha value of 1 and Beta value of 3. \n    The horizontal axis is labelled 'Observed values' and goes from about 0 to 0.75 with labels of  0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6.\n    The vertical axis is labelled 'Freq.' and goes from 0 to 17.5 with labels of 0, 5, 10, and 15.\n    The bar chart has 7 vertical bars, each 0.1 units wide. The first bar starts at 0 and the last bar ends at 0.7.\n    The tallest bars are to the left (towards 0) with the bars getting shorter as they approach 0.75. The tallest bar is for the interval 0 to 0.1 and has a height of 17.\n\nWhen you are creating sub-figures, you must keep the ordering of the sub-figures in mind. Your code, sub-captions, and alt text need to be in the same order, top-to-bottom. The rendered plots will get placed left-to-right to fill up a each row before moving down to the next row.\nI highly recommend that you use the above approach to using sub-figures as this will create cross-referencable sub-figures in a reproducible manner.\n\n5.4.2.1 Alt Text and Long Descriptions\nUnlike faceting, each sub-figure can have their own alt text. However, the alt text needs to be set manually (see Section 5.3.1). Keep in mind the best practices for alt text.\nFor long descriptions, we follow the same process as for a single plot. The only catch here is that you now have more plots all in the same space. You’ll have to be careful with your descriptions to make sure that they match up with the appropriate plot.\n\n\n\n\nImage ALT text.

If you’ve read a text and come across sentences such as “See Figure 1” or “as shown in Table 3.2”, you’ve read sentences the incorporate cross-referencing. Multiple document systems will help you do cross-referencing including Microsoft Word, LaTeX, and Quarto. It is often best to let those systems handle cross-referencing rather than you attempt to do it by hand. The computer is pretty good (better than us) at the tedious aspect of keeping the number all sorted.\nUsing good cross-referencing practices helps to create a cohesive narrative that fully incorporates all of your elements. Further, this allows your document to becomes dynamically updatable and more reproducible. All of which feed into creating items that align with Open Science principles.\nThe first thing that you have to do if you want to cross-reference elements is you have to make sure that each element you want is uniquely named. For Tables and Figures, this is where the label code chunk option comes into play. For code chunks, you’ll use the lst-label option.\nin the Quarto document, where{#sec-setElements} is the label.\nNotice that every name follows a similar naming convention: prefix-uniqueName. The prefix specifies the cross-reference type and is what Quarto uses to keep track of numbering and add key words. The dash, -, separates the prefix from the unique name. When coming up with unique names, be sure to follow good naming practices: no spaces, don’t start with numerals, and avoid special characters–including the underscore.\nThere are multiple prefix that are built into Quarto.

This means that we should be clear about who did want in a group project. We can leverage YAML to record what roles each author as shown back in Section 1.4 and Listing 1.10.\nIn addition to setting roles as part of the author metadata, we also need to list contributions in two other places: each code chunk and at the end of the report.\nListing contributions in code chunks can vary in the amount of details. However, the most basic way of listing contributions is to list who is taking responsibility for a particular block of code. When working in a team, we strongly recommend using a two-layered approach to listing responsibility.\nYou can use either approach when working in teams. However, if you are going to use the terms Driver/Navigator (or Writer/Observer), then you need to make sure that you truly used paired programming. In any case, you’ll use these terms in your code chunks to convey who is taking responsibility. Listing 7.1 shows an easy way to convey who contributed to a code chunk and is therefore taking responsibility. In this instance, Neil took responsibility for originally coming up with the code.

    "text": "7.2 Contributions Paragraph\nThe second additional place we need to list author contributions is a section at the end of our report, before the References and any appendices. In this section, we will put a paragraph or listing of what each other contributed. The choice of formatting is up to you: you can use complete sentences or just list each author (by full name or initials) followed by which roles they fulfilled. For example,\n\nAuthor Contributions\nNeil J. Hatfield: Conceptualization, Project Administration, Supervision, Writing-Original Draft, Writing-Review & Editing. Veronica Bubb: Formal Analysis, Methodology, Visualization, Writing-Original Draft, Writing-Review & Editing. Matthew Beckman: Data Curation, Formal Analysis, Resources, Visualization, Writing-Original Draft, Writing-Review & Editing.\n\nThis is a common approach to the Author Contributions Section. Notice that each author has their name in boldface. You could alternatively use each author’s initial (e.g., NJH, VB, and MB) in place of their names.\nIn this example and that of Listing 1.10, we have made use of pre-defined roles, which are explained in the following section.\n\n7.2.1 Author Roles\nIn 2022 the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) approved the Contributor Role Taxonomy (CRediT) for use. CRediT provides a set of 14 standardized roles that cover the key type of contributions that are typically made in research settings. This taxonomy should cover most of what you’ll encounter in your careers. Table 7.1 provides a quick overview of each role.\n\n\n\nTable 7.1: CRediT Roles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRole\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nConceptualization\nIdeas; formulation or evolution of overarching research goals and aims.\n\n\nData Curation\nManagement activities to annotate (produce metadata), scrub data and maintain research data (including software code, where it is necessary for interpreting the data itself) for initial use and later re-use.\n\n\nFormal Analysis\nApplication of statistical, mathematical, computational, or other formal techniques to analyze or synthesize study data.\n\n\nFunding Acquisition\nAcquisition of the financial support for the project leading to this publication.\n\n\nInvestigation\nConducting a research and investigation process, specifically performing the experiments, or data/evidence collection.\n\n\nMethodology\nDevelopment or design of methodology; creation of models.\n\n\nProject Administration\nManagement and coordination responsibility for the research activity planning and execution.\n\n\nResources\nProvision of study materials, reagents, materials, patients, laboratory samples, animals, instrumentation, computing resources, or other analysis tools.\n\n\nSoftware\nProgramming, software development; designing computer programs; implementation of the computer code and supporting algorithms; testing of existing code components.\n\n\nSupervision\nOversight and leadership responsibility for the research activity planning and execution, including mentorship external to the core team.\n\n\nValidation\nVerification, whether as a part of the activity or separate, of the overall replication/reproducibility of results/experiments and other research outputs.\n\n\nVisualization\nPreparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically visualization/data presentation.\n\n\nWriting – Original Draft\nPreparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically writing the initial draft (including substantive translation).\n\n\nWriting – Review & Editing\nPreparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work by those from the original research group, specifically critical review, commentary or revision – including pre- or post-publication stages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.2 Making the Paragraph/List\nMaking the paragraph or list for the Author Contributions section can be as easy or as complicated as you want to make this task.\n\n7.2.2.1 Manually Type\nThe easiest approach is to just type the paragraph. The upside to this approach is that this should always work. The downside is that you have to remember to manually update this text as things change. This also means that you need to do updates in two places: the YAML Header and this paragraph.\n\n\n7.2.2.2 By Scripting\nAn alternative approach leverages the author metadata from your YAML header. This information is accessible, but only during the rendering process. This makes working with the data a bit challenging, but not impossible. With the exception of one specialized formatting command and the command to get the metadata, this is a data wrangling task that you can do. To help you out I’ll provide the following hints based upon an approach I used.\n\nThe command rmarkdown::metadata invokes the metadata during the rendering process.\nDepending on whether you used author or authors in your YAML header, rmarkdown::metadata$authors will return a list object.\nI found it helpful to create a new list object to store data frames I constructed for each author.\nAs part of a for loop, I extracted out each author’s raw metadata, transformed that into a data.frame or tibble object.\n\nMy data frames were too long but pivoting wouldn’t work out well for me. So I summarized the role information by pasting and collapsing rows by author.\nI changed the new role text by switching the strings to title case.\n\nOnce I had a my list of cleaned data frames, I bound their rows together.\nI used sprintf to build custom formatted character strings with fmt = \"__%s:__ %s.\" and the appropriate inputs from by bounded data frame and saved the output.\nI then used in-line code to paste and collapse my formatted character strings so that Quarto would make the text look like narrative text instead of raw code output.\n\nWhile this approach is more complicated, especially with the needed data wrangling, the benefit is that you are leveraging the meatadata you’ve already provided. A benefit is that you only need to update your YAML Header; this paragraph will automatically update when you next render the Quarto document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantAcademic and Research Integrity\n\n\n\nAuthor Contributions are vital for both academic and research integrity. By making sure that we accurately explain who did what in any project, we give ourselves a mechanism to hold ourselves and each other accountable. In the event of problematic or misconduct, Author Contributions help to divide up the blame. However, keep in mind that everyone in the project is ultimately responsible.",

There are two key things that you’ll need for including references: a citation style and a bibliography file.\nBy default, Quarto will use Chicago citation style but you can change this with the YAML key csl.

    "text": "8.2 Bibliography File\nThe bibliography file is something that you can create via another application (e.g., BibTeX, EndNote, Mendaly, Zotero) or you can use the built-in tools of RStudio Desktop.\nI’m a supporter of Zotero as a reference manager. If you download and install Zotero for your computer, RStudio should automatically detect Zotero and connect with it. To learn more about using Zotero, I recommend the PSU Libraries Zotero Guide (Amsberry, n.d.).\nOne nice thing about using RStudio’s tools (especially with Zotero) is that this will build the bibliography file for you as you add references to your Quarto document. The auto-generated bibliography file will show up as references.bib and appear in the same folder/directory as your QMD file. In your YAML header, you’ll want to make sure that you have the key: value pair bibliography: references.bib. If your bibliography file is named something else, just change the value to match the file name. (The file extension should still be bib.)\n\n8.2.1 Using Zoterobib\nIf you don’t want to use a full reference manager yet (you really should), you can build a bib file on an ad hoc basis. The website zoterobib let’s you add references one at a time to the page. You can look up different sources via URL, DOI, or some other identifier. Additionally, you can manually add a reference as well as edit any existing reference.\nAs long as you are using the same browser tab/session, you can keep adding references to the list. When you’re done, you can click the down arrow on the right-hand side of the Copy to Clipboard button and select the Download BibTeX option. This will generate a citations.bib file for you to download and save to your computer. You can then move that file into your project. Once that file is present and linked in the YAML header, you’ll be able to insert your citations.",

    "text": "8.3 Adding References to Your Document\nRStudio’s Citation tool is generally only available in the Visual editor mode. However, once you get the hang of the citations, you can start including them in the Source editor mode. Keep in mind that there are generally two ways to have a citation in the body of your report: as a parenthetical and as an in-text citation. The parenthetical will depend upon your citation style and could appear as the name(s) of the author(s) followed by the date both inside a set of parentheses or as a bracketed number. The in-text citation generally lists the author’s last name followed by just the date in parentheses. Here’s an example of the two citation styles.\n\nParenthetical: Check out libraries Zotero guide (Amsberry, n.d.).\n\nText in Quarto File: Check out libraries Zotero guide [@amsberry].\n\nIn-text: Amsberry (n.d.) created a useful guide for Zotero.\n\nText in Quarto File: @amsberry created a useful guide for Zotero.\n\n\nThe key to adding a reference to your narrative text is to use the at-sign, @, followed by the citation’s id, just like a cross-reference. Enclosing the cross-reference in square brackets will use the parenthetical style, otherwise you’ll get in-text style.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nBe careful when switching back-and-forth between the Source and Visual editor views in RStudio Desktop. Because the Visual editor attempts to render certain elements (e.g., mathematics, divisions surrounded by triple-colons–:::), you might find that some of your code appear “hashed” or altered.",

    "text": "9.1 Code for the Appendix\nAn aspect of Open Science is being transparent and open about your code. This is especially important when engaged in data analysis. Making your code available helps convey a sense of trustworthiness in you as an author and analyst.\nMaking your code available does not mean that your code must be perfect. No one expects code to perfect. The idea in sharing the code that you used is so that other people can examine your code and reproduce your results. They (and your future self) can then look at those results with what you’ve written and make sure everything is coherent and logical.\nWhen working in a single document, we can leverage Quarto’s powers to automatically create an appendix of all of your code chunks. In essence, we’ll make use of Quarto’s ability to take your code chunks and moved them to the end of the document. This helps to make your data analysis focused on what you’re finding/discovering without cluttering the body of your report with distracting code.\nTo create a Code Appendix, you will need to go to the bottom of your Quarto document. There you’ll want to copy what appearss in Listing 9.1.\nOutside of the four code chunk options (and one empty line), there should be nothing else in your final code chunk. Additionally, there should be nothing except empty lines after the closing three backticks for this code chunk. After putting this code into your Quarto document, the next time you render the file, your Code Appendix will get generated. Additionally, as you edit your file and re-render, the Code Appendix will automatically update.",

    "section": "9.2 Recommended Strategies for a Great Code Appendix",
    "text": "9.2 Recommended Strategies for a Great Code Appendix\nTo ensure that your Code Appendix looks good, you should treat it just like the body of your report. That is, you should generate the Code Appendix and then proof read it! Look through the appendix and look for any problematic pieces.\nSome things to watch out for:\n\nDo all of the lines of code make sense?\nDid you use meaningful names for all objects and functions?\nDid you use code comments to create a structure to the Code Appendix?\nDid you use code comments to help convey what each part of your code (i.e., each code chunk) is supposed to do?\nDid you lint your QMD file and take care of any issues?\nDo you have any lines that are too long? That is, that extend off the page?\n\nA good strategy for the first four is to pretend you’ve never seen the code before and then try to make sense of what the code does. If you find yourself struggling and/or giving an invalid explanation, then that is a sign for improving these items.\nFor the remaining two items, we have a couple of tools we can use.\n\n9.2.1 Linting Your QMD\nRemember that we can lint our QMD file just like an R script. To do so follow these steps:\n\nSave your QMD file.\nCreate a new R script file.\nIn this new file, load the {lintr} package via a library call. (If needed, install the {lintr} package.)\nWrite the command lint(filename = \"/path/to/file.qmd\") where you replace /path/to/file.qmd with the appropriate file path to your QMD file.\nRun the commands.\n\nYou should get a report that will tell you what your lint issues are. The report will provide line numbers for your QMD file; if you click on an entry, it should take you to that particular problem.\n\n9.2.1.1 Course Project .lintr File\nIn the Course Project template, we included a .lintr file that is pre-configured to match the coding style used throughout the assignments (i.e., the BOAST Style). Delete this file to use the tidyverse Style.\n\n\n\n9.2.2 Dealing with Long Code Lines\nOne of the harder aspects to manage for a Code Appendix is handling long code lines. Remember, we generally don’t want a line of code to exceed 80 characters. This can be quite challenging, especially if you are working with data stored online and have long URLs.\nLinting will help identify some long lines. A way to help minimize long lines is to not try to fit all arguments into a single line. Generally, give each argument their own line.\n\n9.2.2.1 Long URLs and File Paths\nIf you have long URLs or file paths, there are a couple of things we can do.\nFor a long file path, look to see if you can shorten that path by moving the file. Keep in mind that the setting up a R Project allows you put all necessary files into a dedicated space and then use relative file paths. Long file paths are generally a sign of using absolute file paths and/or overly complicated directory structures. Simplify!\nFor long URLs, there isn’t much we can do to change these. If you don’t need real-time access to what’s located at the URL, consider downloading what is there and adding the file to your Project directory.\nAlternatively, we can break a long URL into pieces and then use paste0 to glue them back together. For example, consider the long URL:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19xQnI1cBh6Jkw7eP8YQuuicMlVDF7Gr-nXCb5qbwb_E/edit?usp=sharing\nWe could break this into parts on one of the forward slashes such as shown in Listing 9.2.\n\n\n\n\nListing 9.2: Example of Breaking a Long URL\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: breakingURLs\n#| lst-label: lst-breakURL\n#| lst-cap: \"Example of Breaking a Long URL\"\n\nlibrary(googlesheets4)\n\n# Example showing breaking a long URL ----\nbaseURL &lt;- \"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/\"\nspecificURL &lt;- \"19xQnI1cBh6Jkw7eP8YQuuicMlVDF7Gr-nXCb5qbwb_E/edit?usp=sharing\"\n\n# Example showing how to use the parts ----\ngs4_deauth()\narmedForces &lt;- read_sheet(\n  ss = paste0(baseURL, specificURL)\n)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2.3 Wrapping Long Code Lines\nBy default, Quarto will not wrap long code lines like it does narrative text. However, depending on what output file you are rendering to, there are some approaches we can take.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipBest Practice\n\n\n\nBefore relying on automatic wrapping of long lines of code, you should take every step you can think of to eliminate long lines.\n\n\n\n9.2.3.1 HTML Outputs\nFor HTML output files, wrapping long lines of code is a simple as adding a new key: value pair to our YAML headers. As shown in #lst-htmlWrap we will add the code-overflow key with the value wrap nested under the html key (under the format key).\n\n\n\nListing 9.3: YAML Options for Wrapped Code\n\n\n---\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-overflow: wrap\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2.3.2 PDF Outputs\nFor PDF output files, wrapping long lines of code is trickier. Here are a couple of options but keep in mind that they are experimental and should be tested and double-checked.\n\n9.2.3.2.1 Option 1: Add Header Includes\nThe first option we have is to include some additional options in our YAML header for PDF outputs. Depending on how current your LaTeX/TinyTex installation is, you might run into some problems.\nTo use this option, you’ll need to add the code in Listing 9.4 to your YAML Header. Then when you render to PDF, long line of code should get wrapped.\n\n\n\nListing 9.4: YAML Options for Wrapped Code\n\n\n---\nformat:\n  pdf:\n    include-in-header: \n      text: |\n        \\usepackage{fvextra}\n        \\DefineVerbatimEnvironment{Highlighting}{Verbatim}{\n          commandchars=\\\\\\{\\},\n          breaklines, breaknonspaceingroup, breakanywhere\n        }\n---\n\n\n\nIf you get an error message when rendering that the system could not find fvextra.sty, then you’ll need to update your installation and potentially manually install the fvextra LaTeX package: (tinytex::tlmgr_install(\"fvextra\")).\n\n\n9.2.3.2.2 Option 2: Use typst\nInstead of using format: pdf in your YAML header, use format: typst. This will use the Typst open source engine to create the PDF. However, be warned that Typst is under active development and not everything functions as anticipated. For instance, the sizing of images may not be what you expect.",
