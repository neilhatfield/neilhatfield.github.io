                    Rather than a traditional syllabus, I've created a Course Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page for each course that I teach. I did so with two goals in mind: 1) I want this page to be useful to my students and myself, and 2) to help set a positive tone for the semester.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For Fall 2024, this FAQ page will serve as the syllabus for Section 002 of STAT461-Analysis of Variance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may see sections marked with <mark>TBD</mark>. This indicates an area of syllabus where you (the students) will have direct impact on what will happen.
                </p>
                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <p>
                    This page serves as a collection of the most common and most important Course Questions to help you succeed. Be sure to look through the various sections. I will keep this page as up-to-date as possible to address any questions that you and your classmates bring up as well as any changes that we need to make.

                                The class will be a mix of discussion and group work. While I will screen/audio record and post a video for each class, class attendance is essential for your success. Discussion is an important part of your learning. During class, I expect you to be prepared and will call on you to explain your thinking.

                                I'm a big believer in asking questions to get you thinking and I'm okay with uncomfortable silences as they give people time to think and respond. When you ask a question, I will do one of several things: give you straight forward answer (esp. for class administration question), ask clarifying questions (this will help me better understand what you're asking), ask leading questions (to help you claim ownership of the answer to the question you initially asked), and/or open the question up to class discussion. I might do other things such as asking for some time to think more deeply about your question but I will get back to you.</p>

                                I intend for this class to find a balance between the two aspects: Applications and Theory. To this end, we will be making use of some programming so that you can successfully leverage computers to carry out the computational work needed in developingyour skills and applying your new knowledge.
                                <br> <br>
                                I've often found that when students mention "theory" they have in mind proofs, intensive work with calculus and linear algebra, and having to provide derivations. While these things are one part of the Theory side of thing, they aren't all of Theory. In particular, our "Theory" aspects will center on developing the Ways of Thinking that will help you to ask productive questions, look for answers to those questions, and ultimately make decisions in applied settings.

                                The prerequisites for this course are STAT 200 or the equivalent (i.e., Introductory Statistics). I have built this course so that whether you took Intro Stats just last semester or several years ago, you'll be okay. I've designed this course so that we'll have some dedicated review days as well as some Just-in-Time recapping so you can have success in our class.

                                On the first day of class, I'll more formally introduce myself to all of you. If you want to know something about me, feel free to ask. While I'll answer you honestly, if I don't feel comfortable sharing something with you, then I'll let you know. I try to be a relaxed guy and I'm passionate about my teaching and researching how students  think about statistical concepts. I'm a stickler for people saying what they mean and meaning what they say; speaking with meaning is important to me.

                                The way that I approach teaching is grounded in my beliefs about how people learn. Thus, I approach each lesson by drawing upon how I understand your backgrounds and current ways of thinking and then creating experiences which I believe will help you develop meanings and ways of thinking consistent with my learning goals, objectives, and outcomes. The experiences I construct can have a variety of forms; the most common ones are class discussions, asking questions (Socratic method), the use of projects (of various sizes/durations), and other activities.

                                I create slides to help frame discussions and be a resource for you all after class. However, since I often put answers and key ways of thinking on the slides, I do not make the slides available prior to class. I have found that when I do so, students don't do their own thinking; rather, they just read what I've put on the slides.

                                Yes, you will need a computer. You may either use your own personal machine or one of the University's machines for this course. During class sessions, I encourage students to work in groups around a shared computer.

                                You will need at least one statistical software packages such as R, SAS, SPSS, JMP, Minitab for this class. The choice is up to you and your own personal learning goals. However, please keep in mind that I will only be demonstrating the usage of R. My materials are set for R (including example code). If you opt to use another software package, please let me know as soon as possible. I will do my best to find helpful resources for you. Additionally, I can meet with students outside of class and Student Hours to assist with any of the mentioned software packages.

                                No worries if you don't know how to use R or RStudio Desktop. I'm operating on the assumption that a majority of class has no or minimal experience with R/RStudio Desktop. We will build our knowledge of the software together in class. Here are some things that you can do to get started and/or help you when you are struggling:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Explore the R/RStudio Desktop Resources in Canvas. I'll be posting materials (e.g., guides,videos, etc.) that will help you get used to coding in R/RStudio Desktop.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Make use of Student Hours; these are great opportunities to work through any coding difficulties.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Make an appointment with me for one-on-one help if you can't make it to Student Hours.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Practice, Practice, Practice: learning to code takes time and repetition. In the guides, I provide example code. Replicate my examples. Also look out for any challenges that I include as ways to check your understanding. Further, I try to point out additional data sets which you can explore and use as further practice.

                                In addition to a statistical software package, you will also need the following software:</p>

                                <li>
                                    Some type of Office Suite (e.g., Microsoft Office, LibreOffice, Google Doc, etc.) or a plan to use RMarkdown/Quarto.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    In the event that we need to shift to online meetings, we'll make use of the Zoom platform through PSU. Please ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of Zoom's Desktop App.

                                As I mentioned above, you may use a statistical software package other than R. If you aren't going to use R, I recommend that you use a software package built for statistical analysis (e.g., SAS, JMP, Minitab, SPSS). You may also use another language such as MatLab or Python if you desire and are willing to put in the time. As an absolute last resort, you can use spreadsheet applications (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets). I do not recommend that you attempt to complete this course by doing all calculations/computations by hand or calcuator (e.g., TI-89 or Desmos). I have included an entire learning objective centered on your usage of technology.
                            </p>

                                Unfortunately, I can't cover all of the course material AND multiple software packages with time available to us. Thus, if you choose to use something other than R, <strong>you will be responsible for knowing how to produce the appropriate analyses</strong>. I will provide what support I can throughout the semester.
                            </p>

                                You need to be aware that different software packages use different defaults which <strong>will</strong> directly impact your results in this class. Everyone, even R users, is responsible for ensuring that they use the correct defaults.

                                In the past semesters, my students have fallen into three camps: used R, used Python and R, and used SPSS or Minitab. For this question, the second two groups are the most important to examine.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My Python/R users used both languages to their advantaged: using Python to do what they were comfortable with and then using R for what was new to them in either language. RStudio Desktop allows you to use both R and Python as you wish; you will need to install the <code>reticulate</code> package in R to assist.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My SPSS and Minitab users had more problems. While both of these have graphical user interfaces, the systems themselves are not the easiest to work with, especially for importing data. Further, they cannot do everything that I will ask for, which meant the students either had to manually calculate the values of some statistics, switch to using R, or leave certain answers blank.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At the end of the day, students will get out what they put in. For students who were motivated and willing to put in the effort and time, they just as well as comparable students using R. If they weren't willing to put in the effort and time, then they did just as well as students who weren't willing to put time and effort into using R.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                All students who put in effort to use some statistical software package found success in the course. Students who avoided using any technology struggled.

                                The Socrative Student App is tool that I have used in the past. During class I ask warm up questions about material we've already gone over, to get you to start thinking about an idea we're going to go over, take attendance, and/or check how you are doing in the class. For the most part, Socrative is low-stakes in that you're not necessarily graded on your answers but I use them to help me see how you are all progressing.

                                From time to time, you may need to do a quick calculation. Using a handheld calculator like a TI-89, a calculator app on your computer or phone, or something like Desmos is perfectly acceptable in most cases. If you're currently take a test, using your phone would not be allowed and the allowed software applications/websites might be limited.

                                        <strong>Exhibit Intellectual Integrity:</strong> Base your statements on what  you understand and what you're still wrestling with. There is courage and power in admitting to where you are struggling. Avoid making statements that reflect what you believe are what someone else wants to hear. Each of us should feel empowered to express your confusion and/or struggles with the material. This will help make the class much more productive for everyone.

As your instructor, I'll do my best to raise your awareness of these threads. However, I can't do your learning, thinking, or growing for you. Thus, you must take the lead in your education throughout the course. Each of you has a powerful support system you can make use of: your peers and your instructor. You may encounter ideas that run counter to what you understand--do not dismiss them out of hand; seek to understand the nature of those ideas.

When assisting your students or your peers, pose questions to help them construct meaning rather than show them how to get an answer.

                                    Our institution's official policy states that "The Pennsylvania State University recognizes the need or preference for members of the University community to refer to themselves by a first name other than their legal first name as well as self-assert a gender other than their legal gender or their gender at the time of birth (AD 84)." One way we can support self-identification is by honoring the name and pronouns that each of us go by.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Many people (e.g., international students, performers/writers, trans &amp; non-binary people, and others) might go by a name in daily life that is different from their legal name. In this classroom, we seek to refer to people by the names that they go by.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Pronouns can be a way to affirm someone's gender identity, but they can also be unrelated to a person's identity. They are simply a public way in which people are referred to in place of their name (e.g., "he" or "she" or "they" or "ze" or something else). In this classroom, you are invited (if you want to) to share what pronouns you go by, and we seek to refer to people using the pronouns that they share. The pronouns someone indicates are not necessarily indicative of their  gender identity.

                                    Your participation in the class is vital to your development in this class. You can not develop the meanings and ways of thinking indicative of understanding this course content productively if you do not participate.

                                    Participation can take many forms and I try to provide a variety of avenues for you to do so. Some forms are highly visible such as sharing your thinking in front of the entire class. Other forms are less visible such as completing Warmup questions and/or exit tickets. And then there are forms of participation that are in-between such as being a good and active group member when we break into small groups.

                                    The Spring 2024 classes generated the following examples of what counts as participating in the course.
                                </p>
                                <ul style="column-count: 3; -webkit-column-count: 3; -moz-column-count: 3; -o-column-count: 3;">
                                    <li>Attend class</li>
                                    <li>Use the signal cups</li>
                                    <li>Ask questions (when you have them)</li>
                                    <li>Use Student Hours (when you need them)</li>
                                    <li>Complete assignments</li>
                                    <li>Use active note-taking</li>
                                    <li>Talk in small groups about the course content</li>
                                    <li>Answer questions when you can and even when you aren't sure</li>
                                    <li>Engage with the class</li>
                                    <li>Pay attention</li>
                                    <li>Work with others, especially when in groups</li>
                                    <li>Interact with Neil</li>
                                    <li>Contribute to discussions</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    There was a request that participating in group/collaborative work should have more weight than answering questions in class. To me, all forms of participating are equally weighted.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Additional forms of participating can include engaging with in-class activities,completing assignments, participating in Student Hours, forming study groups, and asking questions both in and out of class to list a few. While coming to my office is a sign of an active participant, you aren't required to do so (unless I specifically ask you to come see me). However, you should not treat coming to my office as a complete substitute for participating in class. The peer-to-peer aspect of your participation has a powerful, positive effect on your learning.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Examples of <strong>NON-</strong>participation would include such things as not attending class, sleeping in class, working on another class's work during class, texting/messaging others during class, and/or having discussions with class members not related to the course (instead of doing the actual activity/discussion).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I define participation as contributing to statistical discussions relative to your assignments, completing assignments, and presenting your statistical thinking to the class. Active participants continue participating outside of scheduled class hours by forming study groups, asking questions outside of class. Failure to participate during class will result in a loss of participation points allotted for each class session. Examples of non-participation include, but are not limited to, working on assignments from other courses, texting during class, or engaging in discussions with students on topics outside of statistics.
                                </p>

                                    Your participantion in this course is <strong>your choice</strong>; I cannot make you participate. However, I will tell you that choosing to not participate will hurt your development.

                                    I recognize that participating in class, especially with discussions, can be stressful for non-native English speakers and for native English speakers. However, these discussions (and your participation in general) only serve to benefit you. I ask that you each have patience for others as you communicate.

(Feel free to teach me some of your language; I enjoy learning new words and phrases.) I will do my best to speak slowly and clearly.

                                    I've been recording my classes since ~2014. These recordings are of my computer screen and audio of classroom. These recordings are posted for you to access through Canvas;they are not publicly available. In addition to sharing the videos with you, I use them to reflect upon the class and my teaching. Please do not use these videos as a substitute for attending class. Should there be mass attendance issues (e.g., half the class is absent), I will not make videos/materials available. Additionally, should an individual student's attendance drop below a certain level (e.g., 85%), they may lose access to the videos, materials, and summaries.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I will take attedance every day through one of a number of different methods (e.g., roll call, a warmup activity, an exit ticket, a group reporting sheet, etc.). <strong>I currently do not plan to grade attendance.</strong> Whether you attend class is up to you; I'm not going to force you to come to class.  However, I will point out that we have plenty of evidence from education research that shows when a student's attendance percentage drops below 80%, they fall behind their peers. In my own courses, I have noticed that when students fall below 80% their work is lower in quality and their conveyed meanings are not as productive.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    While not required, letting me know that you're going to be miss class is a courtesy that I hope you will extend to me. This will help me make any adjustments to group activities as well as setting my mind at ease. If you are missing due to participating in an Unverisity sanctioned event/activity, please provide some information about the sponsor. Other reasons include religious observance, particiapting in elections, armed foreces obligations, and taking care of your health/safety. Please be aware that missing a class--even for a university sponsored event--does not mean that you get a free pass for any graded assignments/activities that took place during your abscence. Further, and inline with University policy, some activities may not be made up.
                                </p>

                                    While I do not plan to grade attendance, I will track attendance. Maintaining your cumulative attendance percentage at high levels will unlock access to above mentioned class recordings along with daily summaries, PDFs of the slides, and a reminder To Do list in Canvas.

                                    To ensure that I and my grading team can get feedback to you in as timely a fashion as possible, I ask that you turn your homework in on time. The class voted that assignments would typically be due by <mark>TBD</mark> (ET). In the event that I need something completed before class, I will clearly state so and that posted time will depart from the typical time and be non-extendable.

                                    In the event that you need more time to complete homework there are three routes you may take:
                                </p>
                                <h3 id="late-passes">Late Passes</h3>
                                <p>
                                    If you have late passes available to you, you may use them give yourself an additional <mark>TBD</mark> hours (per late pass) to complete the assignment. You may use a maximum of <mark>TBD</mark> late passes on any assignment. Not all assignments will be eligible for using late passes (e.g., group assignments, quizzes, tests).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You do not need to ask me to use a late pass. These are things you can automatically use in the homework system.

                                    You may also contact me about getting a limited extension. This is particularly useful if you are out of late passes, need more than maximum Late Pass period, or are dealing with an assignment not eligible for late passes. The process to request an extension is the following:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Contact me a minimum of one day (24 hours) before the posted due date of the assignment.</li>
                                    <li>Show that you have made some progress on the assignment already.</li>
                                    <li>Explain why you need the additional time.</li>
                                    <li>Propose a new due date.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    I will review each request on a case-by-case basis and get back to you with the extended due date that I grant you, which might not be the date you propose. Until you hear back from me, please do not assume that you have the extension. You may only ask for one extension per assignment.

                                    Life happens and things can suddenly go sideways. In such an event, please reach out to me as soon as you can so that we can work together to get you back on track.

                                    If you find yourself asking for multiple extensions, please reach out to me to discuss what's going on. I'll do the same if I feel that you've made a large number of extension requests.

                                    Due to the existence of late passes and extensions, I will not make full answer keys available to students until after all assignments are submitted. Calculational answers will be available in the homework system once you've submitted the assignment and the due date has passed. Keep in mind that if you view those answers after the due date, the system will bar you from using a Late Pass.

                                        Throughout the semester, you will have homework assignments, which you need to complete as assigned. These assignments will involve problem solving and will require you to reveal your reasoning, justification, and reflection on your thinking. You are responsible for completing the homework assignments prior to the announced deadline. Your instructor will review your homework and your grade is based on completion, accuracy, neatness, and work shown.

I will only allow making up a missed quiz within the scope of our attendance and university policies. Additionally, some quizzes may be take-home and completed via Canvas.

                                        From time to time, I may ask students to sign up for an appointment to come in and answer questions orally. Each student will be responsibile for signing up and then making their appointment. During the oral quiz, each student will individually answer one or more questions, some of which might be annouced ahead of time. Students will not be able to use prepared notes/materials during the oral quiz.

Others have voted to have 2 tests given during the semester. You will work alone to complete each test to show your understanding of the course material. The best possible preparation for the tests is regular attendance and completion of assigned homework. Making up a missed test will be set up on a case-by-case basis. Such requests should include legitimate reasons with sufficient/appropriate written documents.

The Fall 2023 classes decided to make the final exam optional; with Neil doing what he can to ensure that it would be beneficial to students, up to the constraints of the system. The final exam--should students choose to take it--will be take home and students will be allowed to use a "cheat sheet", which they must upload afterwards. The final exam will be available between 8am the Monday of Finals week but must be submitted by 5pm the Friday of Finals week. Once started, the student will have 110 minutes to complete the exam.

Thus, there will be small projects as part of assignments and class activities as well as an on-going data analysis project this semester. I will provide further details in class.

                                    At this stage in your education, you need to practice presenting your work in as professional a manner as possible. This means that for homework, take home quizzes/tests/exams, and projects, your submitted work should be typed up. You may use any of the following methods (or their equivalent) to prepare your homework: Microsoft Word, RMarkdown, LaTeX, Google Docs, etc.

                                    I have mixed feelings about extra credit. The students who typically benefit from extra credit opportunities are not the students who need extra credit. Given that I use Standards Based Grading, extra credit does not make sense--there's not a meaningful place to add points.

                                    Rather than trying to create "extra credit" opportunities, I will do my best to see about creating some additional opportunities for you all to work on particular learning outcomes to demonstrate your proficiency. Such opportunities will be open to all students and announced to the entire class.

                                    At this time, I have no plans on dropping the lowest score of any type (homework, quiz, test). Generally speaking, individual students will not have an opportunity to make up/replace a quiz score. (Exceptions do exist for students who missed class but followed the absence policy.)

                                    I want to point out that I value your growth. Thus, if you have a low score at the start of the semester, don't stress. If you show me growth by improving on that same learning outcome, that initial low score will have a diminished impact.

                                    No. Curving grades results in two things: 1) the grader imposes a belief for how grades should be even when that is not borne out by any data, and 2) students are not treated equitably/fairly.

                                    When a person uses Standards Based grading (as I do), there is no need to do any curving.

                                    <li>The Spring 2023 class voted not to have tests but to have additional assignments in place of tests.</li>
                                    <li>The Fall 2022 class voted to have two tests during the semester (approximately at then end of Unit 2 and Unit 3). Both tests will be "Take Home". You will need to complete each in the stated testing window (~48 hours) but you will not need to do the entire test in one sitting. Additionally, the tests will be open course materials. Open course materials does NOT include any of the following: working with other individuals (in the class or not), using the internet to search for answers and/or additional information (e.g., "googling"), using websites which encourage/enable violations of academic integrity (e.g., Chegg, CourseHero, etc.), posting test materials (a violation of AI policies and Copyright law). Additionally, past homework assignments will be unaccessible during the testing window. This is to minimize the risk that you're test answers do not get correctly submitted (something which can happen if you have multiple MOM assignments open at the same time). Allowed course materials included:</li>
                                    <ul>

                                    Since regular tests will either be held in class or given as Take Home tests, there is no reason for there to be a time conflict for tests.

For example, when doing an assignment where you are making use of a web app,each student will have a different version of the app. A second example is that there might be elements of a question such as the data sets, context, etc. which are unique for each student. Whenever there are unique elements for each student, the difficulty and expectations for each student remain consistent.

                                    I use a form of Standards Based grading. This means that I live and breath the learning outcomes when thinking about assessing each one of you. Throughout the assignment, each question on your homework, quizzes, tests, final exam, and course project will be tied to at least one of the learning objectives. Each time you answer a question, you are adding to the body of evidence about your understanding for each outcome. I use that entire body of evidence to evaluate where you end up for each learning outcome.
                                </p>

                                    To assist with grading, you'll receive a rubric category/score for each question. These appear in the following table.

                                    Keep in mind is that the typical letter grades are arbitrary assignments to particular sub-intervals of the interval [0%, 100%]. These aribtrary assignments were made in the 1940s/1950s ignoring differences in course content. Thus, they are a poor indicator of student understanding today.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You'll notice that in the Standards Based Grading Category table (see above question) I included a column titled 'Pseudo-Equivalent "Traditional" Score'. This column reflects an aribtrary mapping of the categories on to the interval [0%, 100%]. I have done this one reason only: so that I can better leverage existing technologies (computers) in keeping grade records for all of you. <strong>I do not recommend or advise you to put much stock into these numbers.</strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You can roughly use these mappings in conversions there is an important caveat: you can't use these categories on anything except learning outcomes. That is to say, you can't say "Oh, I have a 90% on Homework #.#; I must have an A." All scoring is done at the item level, thus any potential conversions also have to be done at the item level.
                                </p>

                                    I have made an app (link and instructions in Canvas) that will help you monitor your performance and learning over the semester. I encourage you to make use of it regularly. If you have questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me and I'll give you additional guidance.

                                    In an ideal world, I would report multiple grades to the Registrar; one for each of the Learning Outcomes. However, Penn State is not advanced enough in their thinking to do such a thing--they are living in a distorated past. I can only report a single letter grade. Thus, at the end of the semester, I am tasked with determining the most appropriate letter grade based upon the semester's worth of data on the Learning Outcomes and Learning Objectives for each of you.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I do this in a data driven way thus each semester is a little bit different. This allows me to make adjustments to account for the unique elements of each semester. The general process involves me looking at the following:
                                </p>
                                <ol type="1">
                                    <li>How many of your assessed Learning Outcomes are at the Adept or Highly Developed  Proficiency Level?</li>
                                    <li>How many of your assessed Learning Outcomes are at any of the three Proficiency levels (Adept, Highly Developed, Skillful)?</li>
                                    <li>How many of your assessed Learning Objectives are at the Adept or Highly Developed Proficiency Level?</li>
                                    <li>How many of your assessed Learning Objectives are at any of the three Proficiency levels (Adept, Highly Developed, Skillful)?</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>
                                    Notice that I focus on Learning Outcomes and Objectives; I'm not looking at homework scores, assessment scores, your participation, or your attendance. The assessment scores are a function of learning outcomes but create confusion. For example, you can demonstrate Adept Proficiency on one Learning Objective but Not Yet, Not Shown on another. If the assignment is just those two, the assignment score looks like a 50%--you don't get the credit for the outcome you have a great understanding of. Your participation and attendance will impact your learning, thus there's no need to grade you on them.

                                    You'll notice that Canvas does not show you any assignment statistics nor does Canvas show you your current grade for the course. I've done this for two reasons. First, The assignment statistics are about <strong>classes</strong> not individual people. You should not compare your individual score to a group of scores. Second, students often get wrapped up in the number shown. I want you to focus on the rubric categories and your development over the whole semester.

                                    At the end of semester, I report a standard letter grade to the Registrar. Since I use a data driven technique, I can't say what the exact breaks are for each letter grade. However, I have noticed the following <em>rough</em> guidelines:
                                </p>
                                <ol type="A">
                                    <li>Having at least 75% of the learning outcomes at the Highly Developed or Adept Proficiency Levels.</li>
                                    <li>Having at least 75% of the learning outcomes at the Skillful Proficiency Level and at least 50% at the Highly Developed or Adept Proficiency Levels.</li>
                                    <li>Having at least 50% of the learning outcomes at the Skillful Proficiency Level and at least 25% at the Highly Developed or Adept Proficiency Levels.</li>
                                    <li>Having at least 25% of the learning outcomes at the Skillful Proficiency Level and as many at the Highly Developed or Adept Proficiency Levels as possible.</li>
                                    <li value="6">Having less than 25% of the learning outcomes at the Skillful Proficiency Level.</li>

                                <p>
                                    Again, these are <em>rough</em> guidelines and should not be taken as absolute grade  breaks. There is no exact percentage that is an "A", a "B", etc.

                                    Each rubric category provides a snapshot of your understandings at that time. You'll notice that for the lower three categories, they fall under the umberella of "Not Yet". I've purposefully chosen this phrase to indicate that while you might have proficiency at that moment, I still believe that you can attain the meanings and ways of thinking that are indicative of proficiency. Lean into the words "Not Yet" as <em>you have the potential</em> to improve.

                                        Count the number of learning outcomes and categories that are at the Advanced and Proficient levels for each student.

                                        Create a scatterplot of the number of outcomes at Advanced by the number of outcomes at Proficient for the entire set of students; Cluster results are used for initial coloring of points.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Examine the plot in conjunction with references lines (e.g., 25%, 50%, 75% of outcomes) to determine what natural breaks occur in the data.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Use these breaks to assign grades (A, B+, B, C+, C, D, F).</li>
                                </ol>

                                    If this sounds intense, you're right. This method means that I have an increased workload for grading (and record keeping) during the semester as well as evaluation at the end of the semester. However, this method does a much better job at capturing your understandings than using the typical [weighted] total score.

                                    A central aspect of education is that you build your knowledge and develop ways of thinking that will support you in your life and career. As one of your educators, part of my role is to assess your learning so that I can help you build the most productive ways of thinking. In order for me to best help you, I need the most accurate and reliable data about <em>your</em> thinking and learning. Academic integrity is a key to this process.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A person demonstrates academic integrity when they engage in any scholarly/educational activity in an open, honest, and responsible manner. This is part of our <a href="#responsibilities" class="bodylinks">Shared Responsibilities</a>. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A person violates academic integrity when they act in a way either (dis-)advantages themselves or (dis-)advantages someone else that is not explicitly allowed ahead of time. While people have a variety of reasons for choosing to act in such ways (e.g., stress, lack of time, perssure to perform, etc.), we need to keep in mind that choosing to violate academic integrity impacts everyone. The person violating academic integrity  weakens their own academic growth--they do not receive the feedback that is actually necessary for their growth. The class community suffers as such cases delay giving feedback, and erode the sense of trust in the community.

                                    There are many different ways in which a person's actions may directly or indirectly lead to violating Academic Integrity. Keep in mind whether a person acts intentionally or accidentaly, that action could still result in violating Academic Integrity. The best advice I can give is to <strong>always talk with your instructors <em>before</em> you submit the assignment.</strong> Here are a few of the broad categories of actions that lead to violation of academic integrity.
                                </p>
                                <dl>
                                    <dt>Plagiarism</dt>
                                    <dd>
                                        This action occurs when someone presents someone else's work as their own, including their own. This can describe situations from forgetting to cite a source to copying someone's work without their knowledge. Avoid plagiarism by citing your sources (for figures, images, code, etc.) and giving credit to the ideas and work of others.
                                    </dd>
                                    <dt>Self-Plagarims</dt>
                                    <dd>
                                        Self-plagiarism occurs when a person submits work that they've submitted elsewhere; for example, taking a paper from one class and submitting that paper (even with minor changes) for a grade in a different class without prior authorization. Avoid self-plagarism by talking with your instructors about whether improving a past assignment might be work for the assignment's learning objectives.
                                    </dd>
                                    <dt>Collusion</dt>
                                    <dd>
                                        This action is similar to plagiarism but rather than one person being at fault, multiple people are working together. If one person gives another the answers to an assignment, that person is violating Academic Integrity just as much as the person submitting the assignment. Keep in mind that collusion can happen between students who aren't enrolled in the same section or even the same course. Avoid collusion by verifying with your instructor from the start whether you can work with others; then be sure to give credit to who did what.
                                    </dd>
                                    <dt>Ghost Writing</dt>
                                    <dd>
                                        This action is a more consequential form of collusion. Here someone does and submits work the behalf of someone else, by pretending to be this other person. Typically, the ghost writer is getting some benefit (e.g., a payment) to do the work, but not always. Avoid ghost writing by doing your own work; if you need assistance (e.g., typing assistance) be sure to talk with your instructor and the <a href="https://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources" class="bodylinks" target="_blank">Student Disabilty Resources Office</a>.
                                    </dd>
                                    <dt>Improper Technology Use</dt>
                                    <dd>
                                        What qualifers as proper and improper technology usage will vary from course to course. Generally, this captures any actions where technology plays a central role in the violation. This spans actions such as (but not limited to) using devices that aren't allowed on the assignment, using artificial intelligence systems (e.g., chatbots), using messaging groups to share answers, and getting/posting answers online (e.g., sites like Chegg, CourseHero, etc.). At the core of all these actions lies a person presenting someone else's work as their own. Avoid using technology improperly by seeking clarification about when, how, and what technologies are allowed on assignments.
                                    </dd>
                                </dl>
                                <p>
                                    The best advice I can provide is to talk with your instructor before you submit any assignment. Once you submit, you've solidified your action and there isn't anything your instructor can except to report the violation.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <p>
                                    The major distinction between collusion, working together, and group work comes down to what has been explicitly allowed by the instructor. Collusion is never allowed.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I encourage students to <strong>work together</strong> on assignments. However, when students work together, each one is individual responsible for their own work. Having one person answer the questions, write the code, etc. and then pass the results to the other person is <em>not</em> working together. Rather, each person should be engaged in the problems, sharing ideas, thoughts, and approaches. The individual differences in how we each write and talk should be present in the answers and work each person submits. Working together can enrich the learning of all those who are actively participating.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Group work</strong> occurs when the instructor gives an activity or assignment that is meant to be completed by a group of students together with a single submission for the group. This is not a violation of academic integrity due to the specifications the instructor has set up for the assignment.
                                </p>

                                    Part of learning involves running into situations where you don't instantly have a solution. Rather, you have to think about the problem, try a few things, and then pieces fall into place. You do not have to engage in such struggles alone. Getting help is a great way to help you engage in <em>productive struggle</em> that leads to better learning. However, not all sources of help will actually support your learning and growth. Here are my suggestions for places to seek help.
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Check your course notes and class recordings.</li>
                                    <li>Talk with your classmates.</li>
                                    <li>Make use of Student Hours.</li>
                                    <li>Email your instructor.</li>
                                    <li>Talk to others who are not part of our course. (Use caution.)</li>
                                    <li>Search the internet. (Use caution.)</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>
                                    You'll notice that on the last two I've placed the phrase "Use caution." While you might learn how to handle the specific problem you ask about, there's no guarantee that what you get from these will help you later on in the course. Additionally, there may be differences in approaches that might cause you more problems. For example, online resources (e.g., Stack Overflow) may show solutions that are 1) out of date/not recommended anymore, 2) rely on packages that are no longer available, 3) use techniques that are well-beyond what we're trying to do, 4) and/or cause new problems when you attempt to incorporate them into your work. If you find a solution online or got from someone not associated with our course, feel free to come talk to me about it. We can go over it together and I can show you how we can evaluate such advice.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When you are getting help be sure that you are not crossing the line and having someone else do your learning for you.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Bard appear confident in the answers they provide. However, their answers are not always logical nor stand up to scrutiny. If a person relies upon chatbots to do their work, they will miss out on critical opportunities to develop the ways of thinking necessary to detect problems with AI generated answers.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Overly relying on other tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Bard, CodePilot, Stack Overflow, etc.) will limit your growth. This can then have implications for your job if you are constantly using these tools to do your work. Therefore, unless explicit permission is given for a particular assignment, the entire class community (the instructor, the students, TAs, etc.) should actively refrain from using generative AI tools. When such use is explicitly authorized, that work should be properly documented. Direct usage of output from chatbots should be treated much like a direct quotation; derivations of such output should be treated as paraphrased text.
                                </p>

                                    The class was fairly mixed about using such resources. The general sense of using such tools revolved around using them for limited things and with (extreme) caution. Suggested uses include: helping to debug code, convert formats (e.g., an English description into a LaTeX formatted chunk of code), a study tool to create practice problems, a fancy form of a search engine, and as a source of inspiration. All answers from geneative AI should be treated with great care and used at the students own risk.

                                    <li>Can't use the tool to get complete answers; you can't use the tool to solve/answer a question on a graded assignment.</li>

                                    Issues involving violations copyright law (e.g., posting assignments to websites such as Chegg, CourseHero, etc.) will not only constitute a Major violation of the Academic Integrity policies of this course, but will also entail a separate violation of the Penn State Student Code of Conduct.

                                    There are several policies to keep in mind throughout the semester; some are for this class, others are put in place by the University. Check out them out below.

                                    I ask that you please keep your cell phones on silent and put away during class. This is to help reduce the number of distractions in the room for yourself and others. If there is a call you are expecting (e.g., you have a sick family member) let me know before class.

                                <h3>In Person Classes</h3>
                                <p>
                                    I recognize that some students prefer to take notes via their laptop computers, iPads, or other tablet devices. You are welcome to do this AND if you and some classmates want to build a team notes document, you may. Additionally, we will be using statistical software all semester so having your laptop (or partnering with someone who has one in class) is an excellent idea. However, you should not let the use of your computing device become a distraction to your participation in class, nor should you allow your activity on the device to impede your learning or the learning of others around you. To this end, I will ask that you not be on any websites that do not directly pertain to our class (e.g., Facebook, Reddit, Tumblr, YouTube, Instagram, etc.). Additionally, you should not be working on items for other classes.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Zoom Sessions</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Clearly, you have to use some type of computing device for Zoom sessions. However, I ask that you still try to limit your usage to those things directly related to class. This will ensure that you are on a good path to success in the course.

                                    One of the greatest things about being human is that we are each our own unique person. As such, there is a whole realm of neurodiveristy in any classroom. What some people need to have comfort and success in our class will be different from those of others. We welcome all individuals from    across the neurodiviersity spectrum. I ask that we provide grace and space for all people to be themselves. <strong>Graduate students are entitled to appropriate academic accomodations just as undergraduate students.</strong>
                                </p>

                                    If you are feel like you're having problems in the course, please come see me and let's see what we can do to help you. This might include reaching out the Student Disability Resources office (or other offices on campus).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If you currently have academic accommodations, please make sure to talk with me as soon as possible so that we can get everything in place.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If you've had academic accommodations in the past but haven't registered with the Student Disability Resources office, I encourage you to do so. Having the accommodations does not mean that you have to use them but they do provide you with an additional support system. To start the process, please reach out through the <a href="https://equity.psu.edu/offices/student-disability-resources" target="_blank"  class="bodylinks">Student Disability Resources (SDR) website</a>, which provides contact informaiton for every Penn State

                                    Many students at Penn State face personal challenges or have psychological needs that may interfere with their academic progress, social development, or emotional well-being. The university offers a variety of confidential services to help you through difficult times, including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, consultations, online chats, and mental health screenings. These services are provided by staff who welcome all students and embrace a philosophy respectful of clients' cultural and religious backgrounds, and sensitive to differences in race, ability, gender identity, and sexual orientation.

                                    STAT 380 is a data science course focusing on cleaning and manipulating data, working with databases, and other methods (e.g., decision trees, neural networks, and clustering). STAT 461 is about the Analysis of Variance toolkit/the Design of Studies and Experiments. While there is some overlap (using R, cleaning data), the two courses focus on different things.</p>

                                    STAT 462 is the Linear Regression course. While both toolkits come back to the same general linear model (typically expressed in matrix form), the nature of the questions and data we work with in the two courses are different; particularly the factors/regressors. Towards the end of the semester we will discuss ANCOVA which is the merger of ANOVA and Regression.</p>

                                    STAT 461-ANOVA and STAT 300-Statistical Modeling 1 share an overlap. STAT 461 covers study design more in-depth, covers a wide variety of models than STAT 300, and tries to stay grounded in applications. STAT 300 moves at a faster pace (as it also covers STAT 462) and gets a bit deeper into the theory.

                                    The syllabus for this course (and all other course syllabi) <em>does not</em> constitute a legal contract. Further, I intend for this syllabus to change to reflect the decisions we make as a community on several areas listed above as well as adapting to our needs throughout the semester. Changes to the syllabus will be announced in class and updated here.
