Through my research I'm attempting to identify            progress measures that I can use to inform a hypothetical learning            trajectory for my proposed conception of the distribution of a            random variable. Potential sites for progress measures include            students' conceptions of the following: a trial/case, a random            process, randomness and independence, a random variable,            accumulation, and probability. As my research progresses, I will            make as much available as I can here.</p>          <p>I made the following animation to show how I think about            Statistics.</p>          <video width="640" height="480" controls="controls" oncontextmenu="return false">            <source type="video/ogg" src="1_Videos/statsmolecule.ogg" /> <source              type="video/mp4"              src="1_Videos/StatisticsMolecule.m4v" />            Your browser does not support the video tag. </video>          <p>For the past five years, I've worked with Dr. Pat Thompson on            Project Aspire (NSF funded grant) with several other colleagues. The            aim of the project is to develop two instruments centered on            secondary high school teachers' mathematical meanings for teaching.            We intend for the first instrument (called the MMTsm) to allow            insight into the nature of the mathematical meanings that teacher            has for different mathematical concepts within the            algebra/pre-caluclus secondary curriculum. The mathematical areas            that we examine in the MMTsm include: co-variation (including            variation and variables), functions (functions, functions as models,            and function notation), frames of reference, rate of change,            proportionality, reasoning with magnitudes, and representational            equivalence (structure sense).  The second instrument is an            extension of the Instructional Quality Assessment with the aim to            help us capture mathematical meanings that a teacher presents during            the course of instruction. While I work on many of the different            aspects of the project, I spend a fair amount of time looking at            teachers' meanings and use of syntactic structure within            mathematics. (Also on the grant are Dr. Marilyn Carlson, Dr. Mark            Wilson (Berkeley), Karen Draney (Berkeley), Dr. Stacy Musgrave            (post-doc), and fellow graduate students Cameron Byerley, Hyunkyoung            Yoon, and Surani Joshua.)<br />          </p>          <p>Within the context of Project Aspire, I'm involved in examining            areas dealing with representational equivalence, functions (in            particular function notation), and frames of reference. While these            areas seem very different from my primary research area of            statistics education, I find that paying attention to students'            conceptions within each of these areas is of vital importance in            statistics education. Given that statistics are functions from            $\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, how students understand and            think about functions and function notation becomes central starting            with descriptive statistics. Recognizing that the sample arithmetic            mean is a function and not a value is often glossed over in many            introductory statistics courses. Representational equivalence (an            aspect of structure sense) plays roles in introductory statistics            courses, upper-division and graduate-level calculus based courses.            The two sides of representational equivalence, equality-preserving            transformations and the substitution principle, assist student in            parsing and building meaning for expressions as well as recognizing            potential transformations (e.g. recognizing the kernel of a            particular probability density function). Finally, how students'            think within frames of reference plays an role in hypothesis testing            and design of experiments. Any time use a test involving            differences, students must commit to thinking within a frame of            reference that way the values of the differences for the            observations all have consistent and coherent meanings.            Additionally, students must reconcile one-tailed hypothesis with the            frame of reference they constructed when dealing with the data.</p>          <p>Consider the following example: A researcher collected $n$            observations on the same attribute for two populations, say $X$ and            $Y$. The researcher has reason to believe that for some parameter of            interest, say $\theta$, the value of this parameter will be greater            for the $X$ population than the $Y$ population. Thus, the researcher            tests $H_0:\theta_X =\theta_Y$ vs. $H_1: \theta_X&gt;\theta_Y$. If            the researcher thinks with the frame of reference where $Y-X$, then            the researcher will end up doing a "lower-tail test". However, if            the researcher thinks within an alternate frame of reference where            $X-Y$, then the researcher does an "upper-tail test". The            reconciliation between a hypothesis and how the student/researcher            thinks in terms of a frame of reference becomes important area that            is often left out of statistics courses.</p>          <h2 id="Examples"><a name="Communication"></a>Communication and            Mathematics </h2>          <p> I've found myself drawn to the field of Communication time and            time again. This partially stems from my experiences in competing in            forensics during my undergraduate career. I've dabbled with two            lines of research dealing with communication and mathematics;            reading/writing and discussion groups. </p>          <h3>Reading and Writing</h3>          <p>Early in my career as a mathematics education researcher, I found            myself drawn to not only researching how we teach mathematics, but            also how we teach mathematics communication skills.  (This is            probably where my speech geek comes out to play.)  I believe that it            is well-worth our time and effort as educators to study how we            communicate as mathematicians and how we can get students of all            levels to communicate mathematically and effectively.  We should not            limit ourselves to only working on getting mathematics majors to            improve their mathematical communication skills, but also work on            getting all students to improve their mathematical communication            skills.<br />            <br />            To this end, I have began my research career by looking into the            blending of mathematics pedagogy with reading instruction, writing            instruction, and reading and writing instruction.  This gave birth            to the research project entitled "Investigation into Mathematics            Teaching Strategies Blending Reading and Writing" that I conducted            in Spring 2010.  This study worked with developmental, undergraduate            students at a medium-sized Midwest university.  I spoke on the            theoretical underpinnings and some preliminary results stemming from            this research at the 2010 Missouri Section meeting of MAA.  I then            presented the final results from this project at the 2011 NCTM            Annual Meeting and Exposition in Indianapolis, IN.<br />            <br />            I learned a significant amount from this project; particularly about            getting students to read mathematics effectively.  I have continued            with this idea during the Fall 2010 semester to see what developed            further.  This research project helped me discover that I am truly            passionate about mathematics education research.  I enjoyed it.<br />            <br />          </p>          <h3>Discussion Groups</h3>          <p>In the spring of 2011, I began to study the effect of weekly            discussion of the mathematics being presented to undergraduate            students.  I was curious about the effect of the number of "expert            presenters" that were present during the discussion.  Based off of            an initial wave of research, I initiated a research project based            off the concept of Literature Circles (as framed by Harvey            Daniels).  I worked with a developmental mathematics class            (Intermediate Algebra).  The research project looked at a control            group as well as three discussion groups.  There was one discussion            group that had two experts, one group that had three experts and one            discussion group that had just one expert. Data collection finished            in May 2011.  However, starting my Ph.D. program has put a hold on            this research project.  I do intend to return to this project and            conduct quantitative and qualitative analysis on the collected data.<br />            <br />          </p>        </div>        <div id="footer">          <div align="center"><a href="http://stat.psu.edu"><img border="0" alt="Statistics at Penn State"                src="1_Images/psu_mark.jpg"                class="noborder"                style="width: 318px; height: 85px;" /></a><br />            © 2019 Neil Hatfield <br />          </div>        </div>      </div>    </div>  </body></html>
