                <p>Rather than a traditional syllabus, I've created a Course Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page
                    for each course that I teach. I did so with two goals in mind: 1) I want this page to be useful to
                    my students and myself, and 2) to help set a positive tone for the semester.
                </p>
                <p>For Spring 2022, this FAQ page will serve as the syllabus for two sections of STAT 461:
                     Analysis of Variance (Sections 002 and 003).
                </p>
                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <p>This page serves as a collection of the most common and most important Course Questions to help
                    you succeed. Be sure to look through the various sections. I will keep this page as up-to-date
                    as possible to address any questions that you and your classmates bring up as well as any
                    changes that we need to make.

Discussion is an important part of your learning. During class, I expect you to be prepared and will call on you to explain your thinking.</p>
                            <p>I'm a big believer in asking questions to get you thinking and I'm okay with uncomfortable silences as they give people time to think and respond. When you ask a question, I will do one of several things: give you straight forward answer (esp. for class administration question), ask clarifying questions (this will help me better understand what you're asking), ask leading questions (to help you claim ownership of the answer to the question you initially asked), and/or open the question up to class discussion. I might do other things such as asking for some time to think more deeply about your question but I will get back to you.</p>

                            <p>I intend for this class to find a balance between the two aspects: Applications and Theory.
                                To this end, we will be making use of some programming so that you can successfully leverage
                                computers to carry out the computational work needed in developing your skills and applying 
                                your new knowledge. <br> <br>
                                I've often found that when students mention "theory" they have in mind proofs, intensive work
                                with calculus and linear algebra, and having to provide derivations. While these things are one 
                                part of the Theory side of thing, they aren't all of Theory. In particular, our "Theory" aspects
                                will center on developing the Ways of Thinking that will help you to ask productive questions, look
                                for answers to those questions, and ultimately make decisions in applied settings.

                                On the first day of class, I'll more formally introduce myself to all of you. If you
                                want to know something about me, feel free to ask. While I'll answer you honestly,
                                if I don't feel comfortable sharing something with you, then I'll let you know.
                                I try to be a relaxed guy and I'm passionate about my teaching and researching how students
                                think about statistical concepts. I'm a stickler for people saying what they mean and 
                                meaning what they say; speaking with meaning is important to me.

                                The way that I approach teaching is grounded in my beliefs about how people learn.
                                Thus, I approach each lesson by drawing upon how I understand your backgrounds and 
                                current ways of thinking and then creating experiences which I believe will help you
                                develop meanings and ways of thinking consistent with my learning goals, objectives,
                                and outcomes. The experiences I construct can have a variety of forms; the most common
                                ones are class discussions, asking questions (Socratic method), the use of projects (of
                                various sizes/durations), and other activities.

                                I create slides to help frame discussions and be a resource for you all after class.
                                However, since I often put answers, key ways of thinking on the slides, I do not make 
                                the slides available prior to class. I have found that when I do so, students don't do 
                                their own thinking; rather, they just read what I've put on the slides.

                                helpful resources for you. Additionally, I can meet with students outside of class 
                                and Student Hours to assist with any of the mentioned software packages.

                                As I mentioned above, you may use a statistical software package other than R. If you aren't going to
                                use R, I recommend that you use a software package built for statistical analysis (e.g., SAS, JMP, 
                                Minitab, SPSS). You may also use another language such as MatLab or Python if you desire and are willing
                                to put in the time. As an absolute last resort, you can use spreadsheet applications (e.g., 
                                Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets). I do not recommend that you attempt to complete this course by
                                doing all calculations/computations by hand or calcuator (e.g., TI-89 or Desmos). I have included 
                                an entire learning objective centered on your usage of technology.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Unfortunately, I can't cover all of the course material AND multiple software packages with time 
                                available to us. Thus, if you choose to use something other than R, <strong>you will be responsible
                                for knowing how to produce the appropriate analyses</strong>. I will provide what support I can 
                                throughout the semester.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You need to be aware that different software packages use different defaults which
                                <strong>will</strong> directly impact your results in  this class. Everyone,
                                 even R users, is responsible for ensuring that they use the correct defaults.

                           <p>In the past semesters, my students have fallen into three camps: used R, used Python
                              and R, and used SPSS or Minitab. For this question, the second two groups are the most
                              important to examine.</p>
                           <p>
                               My Python/R users used both languages to their advantaged: using Python to do what they
                                were comfortable with and then using R for what was new to them in either language. RStudio
                                allows you to use both R and Python as you wish; you will need to install the
                                 <code>reticulate</code> package in R to assist.
                            </p>
                           <p>
                               My SPSS and Minitab users had more problems. While both of these have graphical user
                               interfaces, the system itself is not the easiest to work with, especially for
                               importing data. Further, they cannot do everything that I will ask for, which meant
                               the students either had to manually calculate the values of some statistics or switch
                               to using R.
                            </p>
                           <p>
                               At the end of the day, students will get out what they put in. For students who were
                               motivated and willing to put in the effort and time, they just as well as comparable 
                               students using R. If they weren't willing to put in the effort and time, then they did
                               just as well as students who weren't willing to put time and effort into using R.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                All students who put in effort to use some statistical software package found success
                                in the course. Students who avoided using any technology struggled.

                                The Socrative Student App is tool that I have used in the past. During class I ask
                                warm up questions about material we've already gone over, to get you to start
                                thinking about an idea we're going to go over, take attendance, and/or check how
                                you are doing in the class. For the most part, Socrative is low-stakes in that
                                 you're not necessarily graded on your answers but I use them to help me see how
                                you are all progressing.

                                From time to time, you may need to do a quick calculation. Using a handheld calculator
                                like a TI-89, a calculator app on your computer or phone, or something like Desmos is perfectly
                                acceptable in most cases. If you're currently take a test, using your phone would not be allowed
                                and the allowed software applications/websites might be limited.

                                Many people might go by a name in daily life that is different from their legal name.
                                In this classroom, we seek to refer to people by the names that they go by. Pronouns
                                can be a way to affirm someone's gender identity, but they can also be unrelated to
                                a person's identity. They are simply a public way in which to refer to a person in
                                place of their name (e.g., "he" or "she" or "they" or "ze" or something else). In 
                                this classroom, I invite you (if you want) to share what name and pronouns you go by,
                                and that as a class, we seek to refer to people using the pronouns that they share.
                                The pronouns someone indicates are not necessarily indicative of their gender
                                identity. Visit <a href="https://studentaffairs.psu.edu/campus-community-diversity/lgbtq-community/transgender-and-non-binary-penn-state" target="_blank" class="bodylinks">Trans and Non-Binary Penn State</a>

                                Participation can take many forms and I try to provide a variety of avenues for you
                                to do so. Some forms are highly visible such as sharing your thinking in 
                                front of the entire class. Other forms are less visible such as completing Socrative/Warmup 
                                questions and/or exit tickets. And then there are forms of participation that are in-between
                                such as being a good and active group member when we break into small groups.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Additional forms of participating can include engaging with in-class activities, completing
                                assignments, participating in Student Hours, forming study groups, and asking questions both in 
                                and out of class to list a few. While coming to my office is a sign of an active participant,
                                you aren't required to do so (unless I specifically ask you to come see me). However, you should
                                not treat coming to my office as a complete substitute for participating in class. The
                                peer-to-peer aspect of your participation has a powerful, positive effect on your learning.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Examples of <strong>NON-</strong>participation would include such things as not attending
                                class, sleeping in class, working on another class's work during class, texting/messaging 
                                others during class, and/or having discussions with class members not related to the course
                                (instead of doing the actual activity/discussion). 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I define participation as contributing to statistical discussions relative to your
                                assignments, completing assignments, and presenting your statistical thinking to
                                the class. Active participants continue participating outside of scheduled class
                                hours by forming study groups, asking questions outside of class. Failure to
                                participate during class will result in a loss of participation points allotted for
                                each class session. Examples of non-participation include, but are not limited to,
                                working on assignments from other courses, texting during class, or engaging in
                                discussions with students on topics outside of statistics.

                                Your participantion in this course is <strong>your choice</strong>; I cannot make 
                                you participate. However, I will tell you that choosing to not participate will
                                hurt your development.

                                I recognize that participating in class, especially with discussions, can be
                                stressful for non-native English speakers and for native English speakers. However,
                                these discussions (and your participation in general) only serve to benefit you. I
                                ask that you each have patience for others as you communicate.

                                I've been recording my classes since ~2014. These recordings are of my computer screen
                                and audio of classroom. These recordings are posted for you to access through Canvas;
                                they are not publicly available. In addition to sharing the videos with you, I
                                use them to reflect upon the class and my teaching. Please do not use these videos as a
                                substitute for attending class. If we begin having mass attendance issues, I will revisit
                                making such videos.
                            </p>

                               Whether you attend class is up to you; I'm not going to force you to come to class. However, 
                               I will point out that we have plenty of evidence from education research that shows when a 
                               student's attendance percentage drops below 80%, they fall behind their peers. In my own courses,
                               I have noticed that when students fall below 80% their work is lower in quality and their
                               conveyed meanings are not as productive.

                                If you need to miss class, send me a quick note. You do not need to share details with me.
                                If you will be absent from class due to a religious observance or practice as well as participating
                                in an university sanctioned event/activity, you are responsible for informing me during the first week
                                of class. Additionally, you'll want to make use of the <a href="https://undergrad.psu.edu/aappm/class_absence_accessible.pdf" class="bodylinks" target="_blank">University's Class Absence Form</a>.
                                I will work with you on alternative and reasonable arrangements for any time missed.

                    <div class="collapsible-content">

                           <p>To ensure that I and my grading team can get feedback to you in as timely a fashion as possible, I ask that you turn your homework in on time. In the event that you need more time to complete homework there are two routes you may take:</p>
                           <h4>Late Passes</h4>
                           <p>If you have late passes available to you, you may use them give yourself an additional 24 hours to complete the assignment. You may use a maximum of two late passes on any assignment (one for the calculation checks and one for the write up submission). Not all assignments will be eligible for using late passes (e.g., group assignment, quizzes, tests).</p>
                           <p>You do not need to ask me to use a late pass. These are things you can automatically use in the homework system.</p>
                           <h4>Extension Requests</h4>
                            <p>You may also contact me about getting a limited extension. This is particularly useful if you are out of late passes, need more than 24 hours, or are dealing with an assignment not eligible for late passes. The process to request an extension is the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Contact me a minimum of one day/24 hours before the posted due date of the assignment.</li>
                                <li>Show that you have made some progress on the assignment already.</li>
                                <li>Explain why you need the additional time.</li>
                                <li>Propose a new due date.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>I will review each request on a case-by-case basis and get back to you with the extended due date that I grant you, which might not be the date you propose. Until you hear back from me, please do not assume that you have the extension. You may only ask for one extension per assignment.</p>
                            <h4>Emergency Extensions/Illness</h4>
                            <p>Life happens and things can suddenly go sideways. In such an event, please reach out to me as soon as you can so that we can work together to get you back on track.</p>
                            <p>If you find yourself asking for multiple extensions, please reach out to me to discuss what’s going on. I’ll do the same if I feel that you’ve made a large number of extension requests.</p>
                            <h4>Viewing Answers</h4>
                            <p>Due to the existence of late passes and extensions, I will not make full answer keys available to students until after all assignments are submitted. Calculational answers will be available in the homework system once you've submitted the assignment and the due date has passed. Keep in mind that if you view those answers after the due date, the system will bar you from using a Late Pass.</p>

Your instructor will review your homework and your grade is based on completion, accuracy, neatness, and work shown.</li>
                                <li><strong>Quizzes:</strong> From time to time, I will give short quizzes, either announced or un-announced (“pop”) during the semester. I will only allow making up a missed quiz within the scope of our attendance and university policies. Additionally, some quizzes may be take-home and completed via Canvas.</li>
                                <li><strong>Tests:</strong> There will be two (2) tests given during the semester. You will work alone to complete each test to show your understanding of the course material. The best possible preparation for the tests is regular attendance and completion of assigned homework. Making up a missed test will be set up on a case-by-case basis. Such requests should include legitimate reasons with sufficient/appropriate written documents.</li>
                                <li><strong>Final Exam:</strong> There will be one (1) comprehensive Final Exam for you to complete at the end of the semester. You will work alone to complete the tasks to demonstrate your understanding and mastery of the course material. The class will decide whether to complete this in-person or as a take-home.</li>
                                <li><strong>Course Project:</strong> Statistics is an interactive field where you must engage with data to help you develop ways of thinking that will serve you well in your future endeavors. Thus, there will be small projects as part of assignments and class activities as well as an on-going data analysis project this semester. I will provide further details in class.</li>

                                <li>Include your name in the document. Sometimes I will print out assignments (particularly if they are short and I'm traveling) to grade. If you don't have your name in your document, then I'm going to skip grading the document and might not come back to that submission.</li>
                                <li>Be consistent. Please be consistent in your choice font type and size. Same with spacing.</li>
                                <li>Section your work. While you don't have to include the entire question/problem prompt in your submission, please include enough so that I know we're on the same page.</li>
                                <li>Follow the assignment order. If a set of problems are given in a particular order, please stick with that order. This makes grading easier.</li>
                                <li>Do not include raw code in your response; just include the relevant output which you then discuss. Any code that we ask for should appear at the end of the submission as an Appendix.</li>
                                <li>If you include a figure or table, talk about the figure or table. You must write about anything and everything you add to your submission. You must go beyond saying "See Figure 1" or "(Table 1)". Discuss what you want the reader to extract from the figure/table and how that helps them better understand the problem.</li>
                                <li>Please spell check.</li>

                                I have mixed feelings about extra credit. The students who typically benefit from 
                                extra credit opportunities are not the students who really need extra credit. Given 
                                that I use Standards Based Grading, extra credit does not make sense--there's not a
                                meaningful place to add points.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Rather than trying to create "extra credit" opportunities, I will do my best to
                                see about creating some additional opportunities for you all to work on particular
                                learning outcomes to demonstrate your proficiency. Such opportunities will be open 
                                to all students and announced to the entire class.

                                At this time, I have no plans on dropping the lowest score of any type (homework,
                                quiz, test). Generally speaking, individual students will not have an opportunity
                                to make up/replace a quiz score. (Exceptions do exist for students who missed but
                                followed the absence policy.)

                                I want to point out that I value your growth. Thus, if you have a low score at the 
                                start of the semester, don't stress. If you show me growth by improving on that same
                                learning outcome, that initial low score will have a vanishing impact.

                                No. Curving grades results in two things: 1) the grader imposes a belief for how
                                grades should be even when that is not borne out by any data, and 2) students are
                                not treated equitably/fairly.

                            <p>
                                When a person uses Standards Based grading (as I do), there is no need
                                to do any curving.

                                No, in that certain aspects of the assignments/assessments will vary from student to
                                student. For example, when doing an assignment where you are making use of a web app,
                                each student will have a different version of the app. A second example is that there
                                might be elements of a question such as the data sets, context, etc. which are unique
                                for each student. Whenever there are unique elements for each student, the difficulty
                                and expectations for each student remain consistent.

                                You are ultimately response to complete each assignment/assessment
                                <strong>as assigned to you</strong> by myself and the way I've set up the assessment
                                system including but not limited to web apps, and the online homework/testing system.
                                If you are experiencing difficulties (e.g., getting a data set from an assignment), you
                                need to contact me as soon as possible. <strong>Do not get the data set from a fellow
                                student</strong> as there is no guarantee that their data will be the same as what you
                                were assigned. Such actions may qualify as violating the Academic Integrity Policies

                                learning objectives. Each time you answer a question, you are adding to the body of evidence about
                                your understanding for each outcome. I use that entire body of evidence to evaluate where you end
                                up for each learning outcome.

                                To assist with grading, you'll receive a rubric category/score for each question.

The learning outcomes allow for you to demonstrate your skills and understanding over the whole semester rather than a “high stakes” exams. For each learning outcome, your scores on associated questions helps determine your status on that learning outcome. There are five statuses:</p>

                                    <li>Using the wrong unit (e.g., problems says data units are inches, student uses centimeters)</li>

                                    <li>Applying the wrong unit to a statistic’s value (e.g., not making the units on values of the SAM reflect the rate nature)</li>

                                    <li>Tests Only: using the word “average” outside of the phrases “average rate of change” and “l’homme moyen”</li>

                                    <li>Restating the prompt as the response (e.g., Prompt: Explain what a probability value of 0.2 means; Response: That the probability of something happening is 20%.)</li>
                                    <li>Only listing the attribute when asked to define a stochastic variable.</li>
                                    <li>Circular Reasoning (e.g., probability is chance; probability is how likely)</li>
                                    <li>Giving a response consistent with specifically identified problematic meanings in class (red text in slides) (e.g., distribution as a picture, distribution as a listing of what values and how often they occur, interpreting confidence intervals with the Fundamental Confidence Fallacy)</li>

                                Keep in mind is that the typical letter grades are arbitrary assignments to particular
                                sub-intervals of the interval [0%, 100%]. These aribtrary assignments were made in the 1940s/1950s
                                ignoring differences in course content. Thus, they are a poor indicator of student understanding today.

                                You'll notice that in the Standards Based Grading Category table (see above question)
                                I included a column titled 'Quasi-Equivalent "Traditional" Score'. This column reflects
                                <em>my</em> aribtrary mapping of the categories on to the interval [0%, 100%]. I have done 
                                this one reason only: so that I can better leverage existing technologies (computers) in keeping
                                grade records for all of you.
                            </p>

                                You can roughly use these mappings in conversions there is an important caveat: you can't use
                                these categories on anything except learning outcomes. That is to say, you can't say 
                                "Oh, I have a 90% on Homework #.#; I must have an A." All scoring is done at the item level, thus 
                                any potential conversions also have to be done at the item level.

                                I have made an app (link and instructions in Canvas) that will help you monitor your performance

                                In an ideal world, I would report multiple grades to the Registrar; one for each of 
                                the Learning Outcomes. However, I'm not allowed; I can only report a single letter
                                grade. Thus, at the end of the semester, I am tasked with determining the most
                                appropriate letter grade based upon the semester's worth of data on the Learning Outcomes
                                and Learning Objectives for each of you.
                            </p>

                                I do this in a data driven way thus each semester is a little bit different. This 
                                allows me to make adjustments to account for the unique elements of each semester.
                                The general process involves me looking at the following:
                            </p>
                            <ol type="1">
                                <li>How many of your assessed Learning Outcomes are at the Adept or Highly Developed Proficiency Level?</li>
                                <li>How many of your assessed Learning Outcomes are at any of the three Proficiency levels (Adept, Highly Developed, Skillful)?</li>
                                <li>How many of your assessed Learning Objectives are at the Adept or Highly Developed Proficiency Level?</li>
                                <li>How many of your assessed Learning Objectives are at any of the three Proficiency levels (Adept, Highly Developed, Skillful)?</li>

                            <p>
                                Notice that I focus on Learning Outcomes and Objectives; I'm not looking at homework scores,
                                assessment scores, your participation, or your attendance. The assessment scores are a function of learning
                                outcomes but create confusion. For example, you can demonstrate Adept Proficiency on one Learning Objective
                                but Not Yet, Not Shown on another. If the assignment is just those two, the assignment score looks like a 50%--
                                you don't get the credit for outcome you have a great understanding of. Your participation and attendance 
                                will impact your learning, thus there's no need to grade you on them.

                                You'll notice that Canvas does not show you any assignment statistics nor does Canvas show you your
                                current grade for the course. I've done this for two reasons. First, The assignment statistics are 
                                about <strong>classes</strong> not individual people. You should not compare your individual score to a
                                group of scores. Second, students often get wrapped up in the number shown. I want you to focus on the
                                rubric categories and your development over the whole semester.

                                Standards Based Grading can be uncomfortable in your first experience. I believe that

                                At the end of semester, I report a standard letter grade to the Registrar. Since I 
                                use a data driven technique, I can't say what the exact breaks are for each letter 
                                grade. However, I have noticed the following <em>rough</em> guidelines:
                            </p>
                            <ol type="A">
                                <li>Having at least 75% of the learning outcomes at the Highly Developed or Adept Proficiency Levels.</li>
                                <li>Having at least 75% of the learning outcomes at the Skillful Proficiency Level and at least 50% at the Highly Developed or Adept Proficiency Levels.</li>
                                <li>Having at least 50% of the learning outcomes at the Skillful Proficiency Level and at least 25% at the Highly Developed or Adept Proficiency Levels.</li>
                                <li>Having at least 25% of the learning outcomes at the Skillful Proficiency Level and as many at the Highly Developed or Adept Proficiency Levels as possible.</li>
                                <li value="6">Having less than 25% of the learning outcomes at the Skillful Proficiency Level.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Again, these are <em>rough</em> guidelines and should not be taken as absolute grade breaks.</p>
                            <p>You'll notice that Plus and Minus versions are missing from the above list. I generally avoid minuses (your GPA doesn't need the hit) but I do use pluses. However, those will entirely depend on the semester's data.</p>
                            <p>There is no exact percentage that is an "A", a "B", etc.</p>

                                Each rubric category provides a snapshot of your understandings at that time. You'll notice that
                                for the lower three categories, they fall under the umberella of "Not Yet". I've purposefully
                                chosen this phrase to indicate that while you might have proficiency at that moment, I still believe
                                that you can attain the meanings and ways of thinking that are indicative of proficiency. Lean into
                                the words "Not Yet" as <em>you have the potential</em> to improve.

                            <p>No, there is a not a formula. As I have stated before, I use a data driven methodology. I will try to type up an example using a past course for you. Here is general overview of the methodology I use:</p>
                            <ol type="1">
                                <li>Compile all necessary records: by question/part breakdowns of rubric levels, and the mappings between question/part and learning outcomes.</li>
                                <li>Compute each student's value for individual learning outcomes.</li>
                                <li>Compute the category values (objective level) for each student's learning outcomes.</li>
                                <li>Count the number of learning outcomes and categories that are at the Advanced and Proficient levels for each student.</li>
                                <li>Use a Clustering Method with the four counts to group statistically similar students together.</li>
                                <li>Create a scatterplot of the number of outcomes at Advanced by the number of outcomes at Proficient for the entire set of students; Cluster results are used for initial coloring of points.</li>
                                <li>Examine the plot in conjunction with references lines (e.g, 25%, 50%, 75% of outcomes) to determine what natural breaks occur in the data.</li>
                                <li>Use these breaks to assign grades (A, B+, B, C+, C, D, F).</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>If this sounds intense, you're right. This method means that I have an increased workload for grading (and record keeping) during the semester as well as evaluation at the end of the semester. However, this method does a much better job at capturing your understandings than using the typical [weighted] total score.</p>

                                Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner.
                                Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State 
                                University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this 
                                principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University’s Code of Conduct states that all students 
                                should act with personal integrity, respect other students’ dignity, rights and property, and help create 
                                and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts. Academic 
                                integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University community not to engage in or tolerate 
                                acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental 
                                ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.

                                Self-plagiarism occurs whenever a person re-uses old work with minor revisions. For 
                                example, if you did a data analysis project in Stat 200 and then submitted that for an 
                                assignment in Stat 461, you're committing self-plagiarism. All work submitted for a 
                                grade or feedback in a course should not be used for another course.

                                <strong>Collusion</strong> is when a group of students work together and submit 
                                <em>essentially identical</em> copies of the same assignment as individuals when 
                                the assignment is <strong>not</strong> a group assignment. This is a form of cheating and 
                                violates Academic Integrity.

                                <strong>Group work</strong> occurs when the instructor gives an activity or 
                                assignment that is meant to be completed by a group of students together and 
                                submit a single write up with everyone's names. This is not a violation of academic
                                integrity due to the specifications the instructor has set up for the assignment.

                           <p>I recognize that some students prefer to take notes via their laptop computers, iPads, or other tablet devices. You are welcome to do this AND if you and some classmates want to build a team notes document, you may. Additionally, we will be using statistical software all semester so having your laptop (or partnering with someone who has one in class) is an excellent idea. However, you should not let the use of your computing device become a distraction to your participation in class, nor should you allow your activity on the device to impede your learning or the learning of others around you. To this end, I will ask that you not be on any websites that do not directly pertain to our class (e.g., Facebook, Reddit, Tumblr, YouTube, Instagram, etc.). Additionally, you should not be working on items for other classes. </p>
                           <h4>Zoom Sessions</h4>
                           <p>Clearly, you have to use some type of computing device for Zoom sessions. However, I ask that you still try to limit your usage to those things directly related to class. This will ensure that you are on a good path to success in the course.</p>

                            <p>Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University's educational programs. Every Penn State campus has an office for students with disabilities. The <a href="http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/campus-contacts" target="_blank" class="bodylinks">Student Disability Resources (SDR) website</a> provides contact information for every Penn State campus.</p>
                            <p>In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, you must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially enrolled, participate in an intake interview, and provide documentation. For more information, check out the <a href="http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/guidelines" target="_blank" class="bodylinks">Guidelines page</a>. If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campus’s disability services office will provide you with an accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early in your courses as possible. You must follow this process for every semester that you request accommodations.</p>

                            <p>STAT 380 is a data science course focusing on cleaning and manipulating data, working with databases, and other methods (e.g., decision trees, neural networks, and clustering). STAT 461 is about the Analysis of Variance toolkit/the Design of Studies and Experiments. While there is some overlap (using R, cleaning data), the two courses focus on different things.</p>

                                stay grounded in applications. STAT 300 moves at a faster pace (as it also covers STAT 462)
                                and gets a bit deeper into the theory.
