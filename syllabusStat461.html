                            <p>The class will be a mix of discussion and group work. While I will screen/audio record and post a video for each class, class attendance is essential for your success. Discussion is an important part of your learning. During class, I expect you to be prepared and will call on you to explain your thinking.</p>
                            <p>I'm a big believer in asking questions to get you thinking and I'm okay with uncomfortable silences as they give people time to think and respond. When you ask a question, I will do one of several things: give you straight forward answer (esp. for class administration question), ask clarifying questions (this will help me better understand what you're asking), ask leading questions (to help you claim ownership of the answer to the question you initially asked), and/or open the question up to class discussion. I might do other things such as asking for some time to think more deeply about your question but I will get back to you.</p>

                            <p>Your success in this class is dependent upon your attendance and participation. You must attend each class meeting. If you must miss class, please contact me via email. I reserve the right to decide whether to excuse an absence. I define participation as contributing to statistical discussions relative to your assignments, completing assignments, and presenting your statistical thinking to the class. Active participants continue participating outside of scheduled class hours by forming study groups, asking questions outside of class. Failure to participate during class will result in a loss of participation points allotted for each class session. Examples of non-participation include, but are not limited to, working on assignments from other courses, texting during class, or engaging in discussions with students on topics outside of statistics.</p>
                            <p>If you will be absent from class due to a religious observance or practice as well as participating in a university sanctioned event/activity, you are responsible for informing the instructor during the first week of class.

                            <p>Many people might go by a name in daily life that is different from their legal name. In this classroom, we seek to refer to people by the names that they go by. Pronouns can be a way to affirm someone's gender identity, but they can also be unrelated to a person's identity. They are simply a public way in which to refer to a person in place of their name (e.g., "he" or "she" or "they" or "ze" or something else). In this classroom, I invite you (if you want) to share what name and pronouns you go by, and that as a class, we seek to refer to people using the pronouns that they share. The pronouns someone indicates are not necessarily indicative of their gender identity.

                            <p>No. This course adheres to the University's Academic Integrity Policy.</p>
                            <p>Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University’s Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity, respect other students’ dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts. Academic integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University community not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.</p>
                            <p>Please be aware that plagiarism, including self plagiarism, collusion, ghost writing, and cheating are all violations of Academic Integrity. If you have any questions, please come talk to me <strong>before</strong> you submit an assignment.</p>

                            <p>Self-plagiarism occurs whenever a person re-uses old work with minor revisions. For example, if you did a data analysis project in Stat 200 and then submitted that for an assignment in Stat 461, you're committing self-plagiarism. All work submitted for a grade or feedback in a course should not be used for another course.</p>
                            <p>If you want to merge projects from 2 (or more courses) into a single project that you submit for a grade in both courses, such a thing is possible. However, you must first ask all course instructors about doing so first and then the negotiations for what your requirements are will begin.</p>

                            <p>Collusion is when a group of students work together and submit <em>essentially identical</em> copies of the same assignment as individuals when the assignment is <strong>not</strong> a group assignment. This is a form of cheating and violates Academic Integrity.</p>
                            <p>Group work occurs when the instructor gives an activity or assignment that is meant to be completed by a group of students together and submit a single write up with everyone's names.</p>
                            <p>Students may work together on assignments, but each one is responsible for writing and running their own code as well as writing up the results to answer the question/prompt. Working together allows students to bounce ideas off one another and help debug their code; each student still submits their own work.</p>

                            <p>There are five major types of assignments you'll be asked to complete over the semester:</p>
                            <ol type="1">
                                <li><strong>Homework (General Assignments):</strong> Throughout the semester, you will have homework assignments, which you need to complete as assigned. These assignments will involve problem solving and will require you to reveal your reasoning, justification, and reflection on your thinking. You are responsible for completing the homework assignments prior to the announced deadline. Your instructor will review your homework and your grade is based on completion, accuracy, neatness, and work shown.</li>
                                <li><strong>Quizzes:</strong> From time to time, I will give short quizzes, either announced or un-announced (“pop”) during the semester. I will only allow making up a missed quiz within the scope of our attendance and university policies. Additionally, some quizzes may be take-home and completed via Canvas.</li>
                                <li><strong>Tests:</strong> There will be two (2) tests given during the semester. You will work alone to complete each test to show your understanding of the course material. The best possible preparation for the tests is regular attendance and completion of assigned homework. Making up a missed test will be set up on a case-by-case basis. Such requests should include legitimate reasons with sufficient/appropriate written documents.</li>
                                <li><strong>Final Exam:</strong> There will be one (1) comprehensive Final Exam for you to complete at the end of the semester. You will work alone to complete the tasks to demonstrate your understanding and mastery of the course material. The class will decide whether to complete this in-person or as a take-home.</li>
                                <li><strong>Course Project:</strong> Statistics is an interactive field where you must engage with data to help you develop ways of thinking that will serve you well in your future endeavors. Thus, there will be small projects as part of assignments and class activities as well as an on-going data analysis project this semester. I will provide further details in class.</li>

                            <p>At this stage in your education, you need to practice presenting your work in as professional a manner as possible. This means that for homework, take home quizzes/tests/exams, and projects, your submitted work should be typed up. You may use any of the following methods (or their equivalent) to prepare your homework: Microsoft Word, RMarkdown, LaTeX, Google Docs, etc.</p>
                            <p>Data visualizations should be computer generated. Some diagrams (e.g., Hasse diagrams) may be included as photos/scans of hand-drawn figures. However all figures should be part of your typed work.</p>

If you don't have your name in your document, then I'm going to skip grading the document and might not come back to that submission.</li>
                                <li>Be consistent. Please be consistent in your choice font type and size. Same with spacing.</li>
                                <li>Section your work. While you don't have to include the entire question/problem prompt in your submission, please include enough so that I know we're on the same page.</li>
                                <li>Follow the assignment order. If a set of problems are given in a particular order, please stick with that order. This makes grading easier.</li>
                                <li>Do not include raw code in your response; just include the relevant output which you then discuss. Any code that we ask for should appear at the end of the submission as an Appendix.</li>
                                <li>If you include a figure or table, talk about the figure or table. You must write about anything and everything you add to your submission. You must go beyond saying "See Figure 1" or "(Table 1)". Discuss what you want the reader to extract from the figure/table and how that helps them better understand the problem.</li>
                                <li>Please spell check.</li>

The learning outcomes allow for you to demonstrate your skills and understanding over the whole semester rather than a “high stakes” exams. For each learning outcome, your scores on associated questions helps determine your status on that learning outcome. There are five statuses:</p>

                                    <li>Using lower rather than upper case for a stochastic variable</li>
                                    <li>Using the wrong unit (e.g., problems says data units are inches, student uses centimeters)</li>

                                    <li>Applying the wrong unit to a statistic’s value (e.g., not making the units on values of the SAM reflect the rate nature)</li>

                                    <li>Tests Only: using the word “average” outside of the phrases “average rate of change” and “l’homme moyen”</li>

                                    <li>Restating the prompt as the response (e.g., Prompt: Explain what a probability value of 0.2 means; Response: That the probability of something happening is 20%.)</li>
                                    <li>Only listing the attribute when asked to define a stochastic variable.</li>
                                    <li>Circular Reasoning (e.g., probability is chance; probability is how likely)</li>
                                    <li>Giving a response consistent with specifically identified problematic meanings in class (red text in slides) (e.g., distribution as a picture, distribution as a listing of what values and how often they occur, interpreting confidence intervals with the Fundamental Confidence Fallacy)</li>

Additionally, we will be using statistical software all semester so having your laptop (or partnering with someone who has one in class) is an excellent idea. However, you should not let the use of your computing device become a distraction to your participation in class, nor should you allow your activity on the device to impede your learning or the learning of others around you. To this end, I will ask that you not be on any websites that do not directly pertain to our class (e.g., Facebook, Reddit, Tumblr, YouTube, Instagram, etc.).
