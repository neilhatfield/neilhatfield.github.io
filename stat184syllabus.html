                    From the <a class="bodylinks" target="_blank"
                        href="https://bulletins.psu.edu/university-course-descriptions/undergraduate/stat/">

                    R is a powerful, open-source programming language used widely for applications in statistics and
                    data science. It is easily extendible, and thousands of user-created packages are publicly available
                    to extend its capabilities. This course will introduce students to data computing fundamentals and a
                    reproducible workflow using the R programming language and related tools. Students will be expected
                    to access, join, wrangle, clean, and visualize real data from various sources (e.g. CSV, HTML
                    scraping, web URL, R packages). The course will emphasize use of "tidyverse" R packages (e.g. dplyr,
                    ggplot2), although students will also be exposed to Base R and other packages. In addition, students
                    will be exposed to one or more integrated development environments (e.g. RStudio) and will be
                    expected to write well-documented code using a reproducible workflow (e.g. RMarkdown, Git/GitHub).
                    The course focuses on descriptive and graphical summary techniques rather than inferential
                    statistical techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In essence, STAT184 is an opportunity for students majoring in Statistics and Data Science to gain
                    familiarity with the statistical programming language R. Further, this class provides you an
                    opportunity to develop ways of thinking that will assist you in using R (or another programming
                    language) to carry out statistical analysis and communicate your findings.

                <h2 id="courseMaterials">What materials do I need for the class? (Course Materials)</h2>
                <p>
                    As a technolgy based course, you will need access to the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A computer running either Windows, Mac OS, or Linux. If you do not have a personal computer or
                        laptop, you can make use of any of the many computers available both in our classroom and labs
                        around campus.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>If using your own computer/laptop:</em> You will need to install R on your machine. You can
                        download the lastest verion at <a class="bodylinks"
                            href="https://cran.r-project.org/">https://cran.r-project.org/</a>. If you have R already
                        installed, you should check the version and update to the latest. As of 8/15/22, the most recent
                        R Version is 4.2.1 "Funny-Looking Kid".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>If using your own computer/laptop:</em>You will also want to download (or update) RStudio.
                        You can do so from <a class="bodylinks"
                            href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/</a>.
                        Again, if you already have RStudio, you should check and apply any updates.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>If you are using PSU owned computers, both of these programs are already installed.</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Internet access so that you can access the course site in Canvas and other course materials.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Beyond the above elements, I've done what I can to minimize additonal costs to you. You should not
                    need to purchase any accounts, books, or other materials. Any reading materials will be linked in
                    Canvas.

                <h2 id="goalsObjectives">What will I learn in this class? (Course Goals and Objectives)</h2>
                <h3>Course Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    The overarching goals for this course are to provide students with opportuntities and experiences
                    with statistical software so that they may develop their programming skills, capabilities to use
                    software in data analysis, and productive ways of thinking for data analysis and problem solving.
                </p>
                <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Students will develop their ability to create reproducible code that others can understand.</li>
                    <li>Students will develop their skills in programming with statistical software.</li>
                    <li>Students will develop their skills in using statistical software to engage in data analysis.
                    </li>
                    <li>Students will develop their skills in collaborative programming.</li>
                    <li>Students will develop ways of thinking which make use of computing power.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
                <p>
                    You can view the current learning outcomes (and objectives) by checking out the Progress Checker app
                    I've created (link in Canvas) or by viewing them through this shared document <a class="bodylinks"

                <h2 id="responsibilities">What Are Our Responsibilities? (Teacher and Student Responsibilities)</h2>
                <p>All members of our class community have responsibilities.</p>
                <h3>Shared Responsibilities--Rules of Engagement</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Speak with Meaning:</strong> Everything that a person says should carry meaning to
                        others. Each of us needs to do our best to avoid vague phrases and pronouns without clear
                        antecedents (i.e., what the pronoun refers to). Explain and justify your reasoning, statements,
                        arguments, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Exhibit Intellectual Integrity:</strong> Base your statements on what you understand
                        and what you're still wrestling with. There is courage and power in admitting to where you are
                        struggling. Avoid making statements that reflect what you believe are what someone else wants to
                        hear. Each of us should feel empowered to express your confusion and/or struggles with the
                        material. This will help make the class much more productive for everyone.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Strive to Make Sense:</strong> There are underlying threads of coherence between various
                        ideas we'll talk about throughout the course. As your instructor, I'll do my best to raise your
                        awareness of these threads. However, I can't do your learning, thinking, or growing for you.
                        Thus, you must take the lead in your education throughout the course. Each of you has a powerful
                        support system you can make use of: your peers and your instructor. You may encounter ideas that
                        run counter to what you understand--do not dismiss them out of hand; seek to understand the
                        nature of those ideas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Respect the Learning Process of Others:</strong> Allow people the opportunity to think,
                        reflect, and construct their understandings. When assisting your students or your peers, pose
                        questions to help them construct meaning rather than show them how to get an answer.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Student Responsibilities</h3>

                <h3>Attendance and Participation Policy</h3>
                <p>
                    Attendance and participation are vitally important for our class community. Attending each class
                    session is an important part of becoming a professional member of our community. However, attendance
                    alone will not guarantee that each person will get the most they can out of the course. This is
                    where your participation comes into play. I will do what I can to provide a variety of ways
                    for people to participate.
                </p>
                <h4>Attendance</h4>
                <p>
                    You will need to attend each class session baring illness, participation in a Univeristy
                    sanctioned event, or religious observance/practice. We know from past education research that
                    absences can negatively affect students' success. I want you each to find success in this course so
                    please let me know if you are going to be absent so that we might work together to ensure you don't
                    get off track.
                </p>
                <h4>Participation</h4>
                <p>

                </p>
                <h3>Types of Assignments</h3>
                <p>
                    Throughout the semester, we'll have a variety of assignments for you to complete either individually
                    or as part of a group.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Readings and Discussions:</strong> we will each need to read/watch the assigned
                        articles, reports, videos, chapters, etc. ahead of the scheduled class session. These
                        artifacts will be the basis for class discussions. In some cases, there may be reading quizzes
                        over the readings. Some of these quizzes might be due before the reading will be discussed in
                        class; others might be due after class discussions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>In-class Activities:</strong> each week we will have an activity packet that you will
                        need to complete and submit. I've designed the activities to support you in developing powerful
                        ways of thinking. Unless specifically stated in a particular activity that students need to work
                        independently, you are encouraged to work on these activities in groups of no more than (five) 5
                        students.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Homework:</strong> You will have several homework assignments throughout the semester.
                        These assignments are meant to provide you with opportunities to practice what we've discussed
                        in class and/or put you in a beneficial position for other activities, projects, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Tests:</strong> depending on the outcome of the class's vote, there may be one or more
                        tests during the semester.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Final Exam:</strong> depending upon the outcome of the class's vote, there may be a
                        final exam.

                <h2 id="inclusion">Is Our Class Inclusive? YES! (Inclusive Practices)</h2>
                <p>
                    As a class community, we need to be respectful and welcoming of all members. Inclusive practices
                    start from day one and are important to me.
                </p>
                <h3>Gender Identity</h3>
                <p>
                    Our institution's official policy states that "The Pennsylvania State University recognizes the need
                    or preference for members of the University community to refer to themselves by a first name other
                    than their legal first name as well as self-assert a gender other than their legal gender or their
                    gender at the time of birth (AD 84)." One way we can support self-identification is by honoring the
                    name and pronouns that each of us go by.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many people (e.g. international students, performers/writers, trans &amp; non-binary people, and
                    others) might go by a name in daily life that is different from their legal name. In this classroom,
                    we seek to refer to people by the names that they go by.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pronouns can be a way to affirm someone's gender identity, but they can also be unrelated to a
                    person's identity. They are simply a public way in which people are referred to in place of their
                    name (e.g., "he" or "she" or "they" or "ze" or something else). In this classroom, you are invited
                    (if you want to) to share what pronouns you go by, and we seek to refer to people using the pronouns
                    that they share. The pronouns someone indicates are not necessarily indicative of their gender
                    identity.

                <p>
                    Penn State University has adopted a <a class="bodylinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

                <p>

                    If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, the disability service
                    office&nbsp;will provide you with an accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your
                    instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early in your courses as possible. You must

                <h3>Counseling and Psychological Services</h3>
                <p>
                    Many students at Penn State face personal challenges or have psychological needs that may interfere
                    with their academic progress, social development, or emotional well-being. The university offers a
                    variety of confidential services to help you through difficult times, including individual and group
                    counseling, crisis intervention, consultations, online chats, and mental health screenings. These
                    services are provided by staff who welcome all students and embrace a philosophy respectful of

                <h2 id="policies">What Other Course Policies Are There? (University Policies)</h2>
                <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
                <p>
                    All Penn State policies regarding ethics and honorable behavior apply to this course. Academic
                    integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity free from fraud and deception and is an educational
                    objective of this institution. All University policies regarding academic integrity apply to this
                    course. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>cheating,</li>
                    <li>plagiarizing,</li>
                    <li>fabricating of information or citations,</li>
                    <li>facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others,</li>
                    <li>having unauthorized possession of examinations,</li>
                    <li>submitting work of another person or work previously used without informing the instructor, or
                        tampering with the academic work of other students,</li>
                    <li>sharing any course materials (e.g., assignments with or without answers; quizzes; exams; online
                        course notes) via personal communication or websites (e.g., Course Hero, Chegg, Quizlet, etc.)
                        other than those communications used as a part of the course,</li>
                    <li>copying from other students, answer keys, or solutions sets,</li>
                    <li>having a tutor complete an assignment.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These are all examples of academic dishonesty. Instructors regularly monitor the web for
                    inappropriate posting of instructional materials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is expected that any work submitted is your own. Class members may work on homework assignments
                    and lab assignments in groups, but each student must write up answers in their own words and submit
                    lab quizzes and homework assignments separately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any instances of academic dishonesty will be pursued under the&nbsp;<a class="bodylinks"

                <p>
                    Should the university close due to weather or campus emergencies, please be sure to follow any
                    directions included in the University's official announcement. You can stay up to date on such
                    announcements by signing up for PSUAlert (<a href="https://psualert.psu.edu/psualert"
                        class="bodylinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://psualert.psu.edu/psualert</a>) and/or
                    following Penn

                <h3>Deferred Grades</h3>
                <p>
                    If you are prevented from completing this course within the prescribed amount of time for reasons
                    that are beyond your control, it is possible to have the grade deferred with the concurrence of the
                    instructor, following <a class="bodylinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                        href="http://senate.psu.edu/policies-and-rules-for-undergraduate-students/47-00-48-00-and-49-00-grades/#48-40">Penn
                        State Deferred Grade Policy 48-40</a>. To seek a deferred grade, you must submit a written
                    request (by e-mail or U.S. post) to the instructor describing the reason(s) for the request.
                    Non-emergency permission for filing a deferred grade must be requested before the beginning of the
                    final examination period. It is up to the instructor to determine whether or not you will be
                    permitted to receive a deferred grade. If permission is granted, you will work with the instructor
                    to establish a communication plan and a clear schedule for completion within policy. If, for any
                    reason, the coursework for the deferred grade is not complete by the assigned time, a grade of "F"
                    will be automatically entered on your transcript.

                <h3>Instructor Absence</h3>
                <p>
                    In the event that I'm not able to attend class, I will send out an annoucement for what the plan
                    will be. This may include having a guest speaker/instructor (a substitute), for work time
                    (independent or in groups), or cancel the session. Such information will be announced as needed via
                    PSU email/Canvas.
                </p>
                <h3>Syllabus Changes</h3>
                <p>
                    The syllabus for this course (and all other course syllabi) <em>does not</em> constitute a
                    legal contract. Further, I intend for this syllabus to change to reflect the decisions we
                    make as a community on several areas listed above as well as adapting to our needs
                    throughout the semester. Changes to the syllabus will announced in class and updated here.
